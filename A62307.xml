            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>GReat are the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>Merchants</hi> Trading to Forreign Parts; nor was ever any one <hi>Merchant</hi> capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding all the Myſteries of every <hi>Forreign Trade;</hi> whence it comes, that there are ſo many ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> (as I may call them) of <hi>Merchants,</hi> as <hi>Spaniſh, French, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> but there are very few <hi>Merchants</hi> that have not ſomething to do with <hi>Exchanges,</hi> either <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> or <hi>Domeſtick;</hi> and yet of all thoſe that practiſe <hi>Exchanges,</hi> how few are they that rightly underſtand it! as appears by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that ignorance of the nature hereof, of the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> hereof, hath undone: This to many, if not to moſt <hi>Merchants,</hi> remains a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and is indeed the greateſt and weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Myſtery</hi> that is to be found in the whole Map of Trade. On this conſideration, for the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Young Men eſpecially, I thought my ſelf obliged to tranſlate this piece, which contains the <hi>Practick part <hi>of</hi> Exchanges,</hi> and as they are regulated and practiſed at the greateſt <hi>Banks</hi> for <hi>Exchanges,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Traffick</hi> in <hi>Europ:</hi> If there be any thing in
<pb facs="tcp:60840:5"/>Merchandize that requires <hi>circumſpection, knowledge</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> here it is; herein Merchants muſt be critical.</p>
            <p>To every Chapter I have added what <hi>Marius</hi> his advice is in this matter; beſides that, many notable things are tranſcribed out of <hi>Latin, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Authors, of all whoſe large Books of Caſes, this may be called a <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may perhaps be judged very preſumptious in attempting to unfold the <hi>Myſtery of Exchanges,</hi> when which the whole courſe of Traffick hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more intricate. But I ſhall for my excuſe ſay no more than this, That I only tread in the ſteps of thoſe that have wanted no opportunities to learn and know the <hi>Practick,</hi> as well as <hi>Theory</hi> thereof; I have but collected what others have written in <hi>Latine, French, Italian, High</hi> and <hi>Low-Dutch,</hi> and made them to ſpeak in a Language that all Engliſh Merchants might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; and this I think I may aſſert, <hi>That the Authors neither wanted Experience to know the Practice, nor Learning to know the Laws thereof;</hi> and I therefore hope, this ſmall Treatiſe will be of great advantage, and tend much to the unfolding of ſome of the <hi>grand Myſteries of Exchanges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None will deny, but that the knowledge thereof is as <hi>neceſſary</hi> as it is <hi>profitable,</hi> and as <hi>profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> as <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and that to all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein; not to <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Traders</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60840:5"/>only, but to <hi>Lawyers, Attorneys,</hi> and others, who muſt mannage, plead and direct the Suits of <hi>Merchants</hi> about <hi>Exchanges,</hi> which they never can effectually do, unleſs they be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the cuſtoms of Merchants; without this it will be almoſt impoſſible to diſcern between the <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>injuſtice,</hi> the <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>inequity</hi> of theſe <hi>Exchanges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Intricate and obſerve, they are, if we reſpect either <hi>matter of Fact</hi> or <hi>matter of Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reſpect of <hi>matter of Fact</hi> they are ſo, <hi>1ſt,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Merchants</hi> (if they may be called <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> or rather <hi>griping Uſurers</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners</hi>) daily ſtudy to make them difficult and obſcure, to palliate their unlawful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Becauſe many <hi>Fictions</hi> are practiſed and allowed of, and that both of perſons and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch as are not only paradoxical, but contradictory.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly,</hi> Becauſe of the <hi>conciſeneſs of the forms,</hi> and the couching of ſo many contracts and obligations into ſo few words that they are ſcarce diſcernable by moderate capacities.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4thly,</hi> Becauſe of the <hi>variety of unheard of terms of Art,</hi> that neither the Law nor Lawyers do well underſtand, the knowledge whereof muſt be learned from the <hi>practice of Merchants,</hi> and not from <hi>Magna Charta, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian, Cooke</hi> or <hi>Littleton,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And if in <hi>matter of Fact</hi> they be thus obſcure, they muſt neceſſarily in <hi>matter of Law;</hi> for <hi>ex
<pb facs="tcp:60840:6"/>facto jus oritur,</hi> what a multitude of artifices <hi>Uſurers</hi> have invented to palliate their Extortion, can ſcarce be imagined; they have puzled their <hi>Pater Confeſſors,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Doctors of Divinity,</hi> on the one hand to, ſalve their caſes of Conſcience; and on the other, the greateſt <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Law</hi> to mannage their intricate Caſes; nor indeed can they agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the nature thereof; ſome will have Exchanging to be properly a <hi>Bartering,</hi> others a <hi>Borrowing <hi>and</hi> Lending;</hi> ſome will have it to be <hi>Depoſiting;</hi> others not knowing what to term it, call it, <hi>Contractus Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatus;</hi> ſome will have it to be a <hi>Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Monyes for Monyes;</hi> others, <hi>Contractus Locations;</hi> and ſome will have it to be a <hi>Buying <hi>and</hi> Selling</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; others again will aſſert, That <hi>All theſe are included in it, and appitcable to it;</hi> and indeed, its not a pin matter whether it be all or any of theſe, if <hi>commutative Juſtice</hi> be but obſerved, nor ſhall I further trouble the Reader or my ſelf with theſe Controverſies.</p>
            <p>Nor with Diſputes about the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> or <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> thereof, wherewith I could have filled a large Volumn in Folio, if I would have tranſlated what <hi>Sigiſm. Scaccia</hi> hath writ about this; I take it for granted, that its abuſed by <hi>Uſurers</hi> and <hi>Extortioners,</hi> and even ſo far is utterly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful. But this notwithſtanding, the lawful uſe thereof, as its moſt frequently
<pb facs="tcp:60840:6"/>practiſed among Merchants, is not to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; only by the way, let honeſt <hi>Merchants</hi> here be cautioned, <hi>That from the lawful uſe thereof they be not tempted inſenſibly to ſlide into the unlawful abuſe thereof, leſt of honeſt Merchants, they become griping Uſurers;</hi> and this caution is ſo much the more neceſſary, in regard of the intricacy of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, and the difficulty of finding out the Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of an Exchange-contract; for as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Proverb is, <hi>Arca aperta juſtum ad pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum invitat,</hi> which is in plain <hi>Engliſh, <hi>Opportunicy makes a Thief.</hi>

               </hi> muſt be its Rule, and Honeſty muſt be
<pb facs="tcp:60840:7"/>the Artery under this vein of Commerce, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Traffick cannot ſubſiſt, or elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Reaſons be urged for its lawfulneſs, and whatever Diſtinctions be uſed, it is unlawful, if not <hi>curia exteriori,</hi> at leaſt <hi>foro fori:</hi> But alas! it is to be feared, that theſe things are little obſerved by thoſe who make it their ſole Trade to practiſe Exchanges. Not but that it is lawful for ſuch as give in Exchange, to conſider the lawful <hi>Intereſt of their Monyes,</hi> their <hi>great Labour and Expences,</hi> the <hi>Riſco that they run,</hi> the <hi>plenty or ſcarcity of Monyes</hi> or <hi>Bills,</hi> the <hi>Intrinſick</hi> &amp; <hi>Extrinſick value of the ſpecies of Monyes they muſt pay,</hi> and again receive (which things, if not conſidered, there is no equality) but that which is condemned in Exchanges, (as was ſaid before) is the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion <hi>and</hi> Oppreſſion, <hi>and the</hi> Abuſe of Exchanges,</hi> palliating their <hi>unlawful Uſury</hi> therewith. So that whatever may be objected against the lawfulneſs hereof, may be retorted with this, that they are not <hi>vitia artis,</hi> but <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficis;</hi> and let thoſe <hi>Bankers</hi> that thus abuſe a lawful calling, conſider, that uſually (as hath by ſome been obſerved) theſe great unlawful Gains have been attended with greater Loſſes, and it cannot well be otherwiſe; for firſt, <hi>Mala parta, male &amp; cito dilabuntur;</hi> ſecondly, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Proverb is, <hi>As long as the Covetous man lives, the Deceiver need not dye for hunger; for the hopes of great Gains makes
<pb facs="tcp:60840:7"/>them run great Hazards;</hi> and thirdly, their greateſt Trade being with (honest) Merchants, whom they credit, theſe often by divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence do ſuffer great loſſes, who often run great Riſco's at Sea, and ſo are made inſolvent, and if ſome griping <hi>Uſurers</hi> and <hi>Abuſes</hi> of the lawful calling and art of <hi>Exchanges</hi> are not concerned, it will be very ſtrange.</p>
            <p>That which gives moſt men an occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and diſprove of this <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Bankers,</hi> is this, <hi>1ſt,</hi> That they are obſerved to be men of <hi>very broad Conſciences,</hi> they will pretend Honeſty as much at any, but they exerciſe it as little; and eſpecially, its hard to perſwade them that they are in Conſcience obliged to remit par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of their Debt to him that cannot poſſibly pay, who not by his own, but by others Knavery, not by his own Folly, but by the Providence of God bath ſuffered the loſs of all that he hath; and then, <hi>2dly,</hi> They that are ſtrangers to this <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Myſtery</hi> (for ſo it may well be called) cannot conceive hom Moneys (which of its ſelf is barren) ſhould ſo fructifie, as if there were ſome <hi>Alchymiſtrical cunning</hi> uſed by them, or as if by Superfactation they could multiply Moneys; they think it ſtrange, that ſuch men, who in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance are idle, do nothing but ſit and write, dealing in no Commodities, neither by buying nor ſelling, ſhould ſo ſuddainly acquire ſo vaſt Eſtates, and gain more than the moſt laborious and induſtrous Merchants: Nor, <hi>3dly,</hi> can
<pb facs="tcp:60840:8"/>they underſtand how Monyes, that is the meaſure and price of all other things neceſſary for life, and which for that end only was invented, ſhould be the meaſure and price of it ſelf, and ſo be <hi>menſurans &amp; menſuratum, regulans &amp; regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum,</hi> and they judge it according to their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical and Phyloſophical Capacities, that an <hi>actio &amp; paſſio</hi> in the ſame ſubject is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>But theſe ſhould again conſider, to write is not to ſit ſtill, or to be idle; and to ſtudy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, and correſpond is the greateſt labour; as alſo, that it is only idle Monyes lockt up in a Chest, and unimployed, that is unfruitful and barren, and that there is a mixture of Contracts in Exchanges, and a buying and ſelling alſo, and that the profit thereof doth not ariſe only from the conſideration of time (though according to the longer or ſhorter time the courſe is higher or lower proportionably) but conjunctly from a conſideration of the Labour, Expences and Riſco of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, nor do they alwayes gain by Exchanges, nor can they that obſerve the lawful Courſe of Exchanges know certainly that they ſhall gain; for <hi>poſito</hi> that the men be able and ſufficient that they deal with; yet ſuch is the variableneſs of the Courſe, that till they have the Moneys in Caſh again, which they gave out on Exchange, they cannot know whether it be to their loſs or profit.</p>
            <p>But that which renders this Art of Exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt ſuſpected, is the Practice of <hi>Re-change,</hi> which is doubleſs unlawful, and I ſhall not plead
<pb facs="tcp:60840:8"/>for it. But leſt I be miſ-underſtood, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what I mean by <hi>Re-change,</hi> and what others take it for; and the <hi>Re-change</hi> that is condemned, is this, When an <hi>honeſt Merchant,</hi> (or other) ſtanding in need of preſent Monyes, comes to an <hi>Exchanger,</hi> and offers him his Bill for ſo much Monyes; the Exchanger prying like a Vulter upon his neceſſity, gives him ſo much Monyes, upon good ſecurity, at an high Courſe, and knowing that the Bills will not be paid, but proteſted, he conditions, that the <hi>Intereſt, Charges,</hi> and the <hi>courſe of Exchange</hi> back again, ſhall be added to the Sum, and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Capital or Principal; this augmented Sum is redrawn upon the poor neceſſitous Debtor; and if the Debtor cannot pay, then the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changer will probably continue it ſo long and ſo far as the Pledge or Security he hath, is worth, always augmenting the Sum, as before; all which at last he forceth the poor Merchant to pay him, though he utterly ruin him and his whole Family; whence by the way obſerve, That this <hi>Re-change</hi> is alwayes with the ſame Debtor, by converting the Intereſt into the Principal, and that the Creditor knows, that the Debtors Bills will not be paid, and that therefore many Fictions are admitted of, and that the Creditor doth by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence extort from the poor Debtor, whatever his inſatiable avarice ſhall prompt him to: And thus they cloak their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurous Contracts, and ruin the poor Debtor; and this is that <hi>Rechange</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60840:9"/>that is <hi>unlawful.</hi> But I ſhall not enlarge upon theſe things, leſt I ſwell the Book to too great a Vollumn.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only here obſerve, <hi>That <hi>Exchanges were introduced by the Law of Nations</hi>
               </hi> (as all <hi>Commerce was</hi>) and was invented for the eaſe in Traffick, and is now ſo neceſſary an Appendix thereto, that without it Trade can ſcarcely ſubſiſt, its the ſoul and life thereof, and is of the very Eſſence of all Commerce and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation. The <hi>variety of Coyns,</hi> and their <hi>Extrinſick</hi> and <hi>Intrinſick Values</hi> gave the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereof, and the deſign was to prevent the hazard and charges of tranſporting Monyes from place to place to traffique with. But now by the Policy of Merchants, its turned to a moſt profitable Trade, and its evident enough, that they are now neither Fools nor Prodigals that will for a ſmall piece of Paper or two, give away ſo much ready Monyes; for thoſe Bills of Exchange they receive do uſually bring all back again with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; yea, now according to the number of theſe Bills, men may ſafely value their Eſtates; To which purpoſe <hi>Sigſin. Scaccia</hi> tells a pretty ſtory: <hi>
                  <q>An Italian <hi>Merchant being in company with ſome Scholars, they were diſcourſing of a certain learned Perſon that was ſhortly expected to come to a certain place, whom highly commending for his learning, they ſaid, he was</hi> Omni literârum genere imbutus; <hi>of whom preſently the Merchant demands,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:60840:9"/>Quas haberet Literas? <hi>To whom they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi> That he was ſo and ſo qualified, had <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> on his Fingers ends, &amp;c. <hi>Whereat the Merchant lift up his hands, and ſaid,</hi> Is that all? What elſe ſhould he have? <hi>ſays another.</hi> Ho <hi>(ſays the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant)</hi> if he hath no Letters of Credit, <hi>Literas Combij</hi> (Bills of Exchange) all the reſt is of no value.</q>
               </hi> But not to detain the <hi>Reader</hi> any longer here, and leave the Book to his puruſal and approbation, and I queſtion not, but thoſe that ſhall have occaſion to buy and puruſe it, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed find that its both uſeful and neceſſary for all <hi>Merchants,</hi> eſpecially for thoſe that are Young.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. THE word EXCHANGE in its largeſt Signification, may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>any kindof Change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> II. In a more reſtrained and limitted ſenſe, it may be referred to <hi>all ſorts of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique</hi> whatever.</p>
               <p>III. But that kind of <hi>Exchange,</hi> that here ſhall be treated of, is yet taken in a more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60840:13"/>ſenſe, and only referred to a <hi>Trading in, or with Monyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. From the <hi>variety of Coyns,</hi> and the manifold <hi>diſtinctions of Monyes</hi> (thoſe Coyns and Allays, that are currant in one Nation, being not currant in another; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſeeing almoſt all the <hi>world</hi> over, all Trade muſt be driven with Monyes) did this Trade of, and in Monyes (which we call EXCHANGE) derive its Original.</p>
               <p>V. This <hi>Exchange</hi> is two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> An Exchanging of Monyes for Monyes, one Coyn or ſort for another; and a giving of Money upon Exchange for a Bill, &amp;c. The former of theſe is Petty Exchange, the latter Real.</p>
               <p>VI. The Exchanging of one ſort or ſpecies for another, is alſo two-fold; either <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>without Profit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. When its done <hi>without Profit,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called a <hi>Trade,</hi> but is done meerly out of Friendſhip, and as a Courteſie; and then there is an equal and juſt Valuation of both the ſorts of Coyn, according to their Allay, or their Price currant, or Intrinſick and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Value.</p>
               <p>VIII. But if <hi>Profit</hi> by the Exchange, be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60840:13"/>deſigned by either Party, then one Party al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the other a certain <hi>Profit</hi> upon the certain Species he deſireth; and that <hi>Profit</hi> is called by the Italians <hi>Aggio,</hi> by the Dutch <hi>Opgelt,</hi> which we may call <hi>Advance,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe-Monyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. But then, this laſt kind of <hi>Exchange,</hi> which is done for <hi>Advance</hi> or <hi>Aggio,</hi> is no free and lawful Trade, ſave to thoſe only that are permitted by Authority to uſe it, who are alſo obliged to obſerve certain <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi> in the uſe thereof, ſuch are <hi>Brogers, Bankers, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. And to prevent all <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and the <hi>too great Advance</hi> of any particular ſpeices of Monyes, the Cities of <hi>Amſterdam, Hamburge,</hi> &amp;c. have erected a <hi>Bank</hi> for the <hi>Regulation</hi> thereof, according to the true Intrinſick Value of every Species.</p>
               <p>XI. <hi>Exchange</hi> that is done by <hi>Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> conſiſts in a <hi>Contract</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> betwixt two Parties, whereby the one Party gives his Bill for the Payment of a certain preciſe Sum of Monyes, at a certain and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted time, in a certain and limitted place, for the value of the ſame Sum already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or preſently to be paid by the other Party; this is called by <hi>Marius, Real Exchange.</hi>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60840:14"/>
               <p>XII. Exchange may again be ſubdivided, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Merchants,</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers Exchange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. <hi>Merchants Exchange</hi> conſiſts in a Trading in or with Monyes from one Place, City or Nation, to another, upon an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Profit; and this ſort of Trade, is by way of Excellency termed, <hi>Simple Exchange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIV. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers Exchange</hi> conſiſts in a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Monyes upon Intereſt, with condition to receive the ſame Sum of Monyes, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Profit, at a certain time, and in the ſame place; and this is called by <hi>Marius, Dry Exchange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XV. <hi>Merchants Exchange</hi> is either <hi>actual,</hi> and that which is <hi>really performed</hi> and <hi>accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;</hi> or only <hi>pro Formâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVI. The <hi>Real</hi> Merchants Exchange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a real and effectual Contract and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation betwixt the <hi>Drawer</hi> &amp; the <hi>Remitter,</hi> concerning the <hi>Courſe of Exchange,</hi> and the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place of Payment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVII. But that <hi>Exchange</hi> that is only <hi>pro Formâ,</hi> conſiſts only in a <hi>Conſent,</hi> that the Name of a certain Perſon be uſed, as the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60840:14"/>
                  <hi>Remitter,</hi> (that the Bill may want nothing of its Formality) without any real Contract or Negotiation.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Again, this <hi>real Exchange</hi> is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either <hi>Certain</hi> or <hi>Conditional.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. <hi>Real Certain Exchange,</hi> is, when the Sum expreſt in the Bill muſt <hi>really</hi> and <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> be paid.</p>
               <p>XX. But <hi>Conditional Exchange</hi> is, when the Payment of the Sum, named in the Bill, muſt firſt be made, upon the arrival of ſome Ship, or of ſome certain Goods, or upon ſome other Conditions.</p>
               <p>XXI. To the Compleating of an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-Negotiation,</hi> four Perſons are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and required, two at the place where the Courſe, Place, Time of Payment, and the Sum are agreed on, to wit the <hi>Drawer</hi> and the <hi>Remitter:</hi> and at the Place of Payment are alſo two, to wit, the <hi>Perſon</hi> on whom the Bill is drawn, who muſt <hi>Pay;</hi> and the <hi>Perſon</hi> to whom the Bill is remitted, who muſt <hi>Receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXII. <hi>Exchange</hi> is again ſubdivided into <hi>Negotiated,</hi> and <hi>diſcounted Exchange,</hi> or <hi>Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contred Exchange.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60840:15"/>
               <p>XXIII. <hi>Negotiated,</hi> is, when the <hi>Drawer</hi> and the <hi>Remitter</hi> are <hi>two diſtinct Perſons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom there hath been an <hi>actual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> concerning the <hi>courſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>XXIV. <hi>Diſcounted Exchange,</hi> is, when the <hi>Drawer</hi> and the <hi>Remitter</hi> is <hi>one and the ſame Perſon,</hi> that at the ſame time <hi>draws</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXV. <hi>Negotiated Exchange,</hi> is again <hi>two-fold;</hi> either <hi>Pure,</hi> or <hi>Mixt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXVI. A <hi>Pure Negotiated Exchange,</hi> is, when really Money is given for Moneys to be received, according to the contract betwixt the <hi>Drawer</hi> and the <hi>Remitter,</hi> whereby the <hi>Drawer</hi> obligeth himſelf to pay the value he hath received of the <hi>Remitter,</hi> according to the courſe in another place, at a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe time.</p>
               <p>XXVII. <hi>Mixt Exchange</hi> conſiſts in a contract betwixt <hi>Debtor</hi> and <hi>Creditor,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Debtor</hi> obligeth himſelf to the true payment of the Monyes, according to the cuſtom of Exchange.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. Again, all <hi>Exchanges</hi> are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </p>
               <p>XXIX. When it is for <hi>Proper account,</hi> it concerns the Perſon, that is either <hi>Drawer</hi> or <hi>Remitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXX. When its for the <hi>Principals ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> the <hi>Factor</hi> treats and concludes in his <hi>own Name,</hi> but the <hi>Sum,</hi> &amp;c. is for the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXI. And it is in the <hi>Name of another,</hi> when its done only by the <hi>full Power</hi> and <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Attorney of another.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Duty of <hi>Mackelers</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-Brogers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. <hi>EXCHANGE</hi> is concluded, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Mackelers</hi> or <hi>Brogers,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60840:16"/>alone betwixt themſelves, or by bringing the Parties face to face.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Brogers,</hi> &amp;c. are Perſons Sworn and Authorized by the Magiſtrate, whoſe Work and Trade it is, to enquire of Perſons that have any Monyes to <hi>remit</hi> or to <hi>draw,</hi> and to <hi>argree</hi> ſuch Perſons concerning the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, acting Impartially between them both.</p>
               <p>III. It is their Duty to be <hi>Diligent, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>Private,</hi> and not to <hi>Cheat</hi> or <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach</hi> either the <hi>Drawer</hi> or the <hi>Remitter,</hi> in any wiſe.</p>
               <p>IV. He muſt be content with that Reward for his Pains and Labour, that the Magiſtrate hath allowed him, which is called by the the <hi>Hollanders</hi> COURTAGIE: He muſt not exact more of one than another, nor ſerve any man for nothing.</p>
               <p>V. Thoſe <hi>Covetous Exchangers</hi> that will ſave the <hi>Courtagie,</hi> by concluding their own <hi>Exchanges</hi> face to face, without the help of the <hi>Brogers,</hi> on that uſe to deduct from their allowance, or that will uſe <hi>Ignoramus</hi>'s becauſe they will ſerve for leſs than the Allowance, or may be for nothing at all, do ſometimes in the Courſe of <hi>Exchange,</hi> pay the <hi>Courtagie</hi> double and tribble.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60840:16"/>
               <p>VI. A <hi>Broger</hi> muſt be very diligent and prudent, and muſt firſt of all know of the <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Remitter,</hi> to what certain place they will Exchange; and if it be to ſuch a place where there is alwayes a <hi>certain <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſance</hi> obſerved in the Payment of Bills, then he hath nothing to do, but to treat of the <hi>Courſe</hi> or <hi>Price</hi> of <hi>Exchange.</hi> But in caſe they would Exchange to Places, where <hi>no certain <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſance</hi> is kept, but the Bills muſt be made at ſhorter or longer date or ſight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then he muſt be expreſs and certain, as to the <hi>preciſe Time of Payment,</hi> and other neceſſary Conditions.</p>
               <p>VII. When the <hi>Mackeler</hi> or <hi>Broger</hi> hath concluded with any, then muſt he tell the <hi>Drawer,</hi> to whom he will have his Bills made Payable, and muſt thereupon note in his Book, <hi>What the Sum was for which he concluded; What time for Payment of the Bill; To whom it muſt be paid; From whom the Value muſt be received;</hi> and <hi>At what Courſe the Exchange was made:</hi> Which <hi>Memorandum</hi> he muſt give to the <hi>Drawer,</hi> that he may accordingly make or endorſe his Bills of Exchange.</p>
               <p>VIII. Its the <hi>Brogers</hi> Duty alſo, to <hi>fetch</hi> the Bills, when they are made, from the <hi>Drawer,</hi> and <hi>carry</hi> them to the <hi>Remitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60840:17"/>
               <p>IX. He is obliged to keep a perfect and true <hi>Regiſter</hi> of every particular Bill; and muſt Note in his Book at home, <hi>Who the Parties were,</hi> as well the <hi>Remitter</hi> as the <hi>Drawer; To what Place the Bill was directed, and to whom; To whom it was Payable; At what Time; and what the Courſewas; And the preciſe Day when this was concluded on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. And in caſe of any Difference betwixt the <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Remitter,</hi> the Word and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the <hi>Broger,</hi> that is of known Honeſty, will be the <hi>greateſt Evidence,</hi> and the <hi>Beſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. No Prudent Merchant will oblige himſelf to one <hi>Broger</hi> alwayes, nor prefer one to another, but allow to any of them their <hi>Courtagie</hi> (without making any Difference among them) that ſhall firſt offer the Courſe to him, at which he reſolves to conclude; By thus doing, he diſobligeth none of them, but animates them all to his Service.</p>
               <p>XII. Its a great Fault and Abuſe for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to <hi>Contract</hi> with the <hi>Broger,</hi> upon hazard, before the Exchange-time.</p>
               <p>XIII. Its a great Imprudence in any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that hath but little Credit of his own, when he hath occaſion to draw, to give
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60840:17"/>Orders to all the <hi>Mackelers</hi> or <hi>Brogers</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>XIV. A <hi>Broger,</hi> in the concluding of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, muſt not uſe his Liberty, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any thing, either as to the <hi>Time</hi> or the <hi>Courſe,</hi> without Order.</p>
               <p>XV. A <hi>Drawer</hi> hath great reaſon to be Angry at the <hi>Broger,</hi> when he without his Knowledge, concludes any thing at a lower or diſadvantagiouſer Courſe, than he gave order for, though the <hi>Broger</hi> ſhould offer to make good the loſs; for his Credit is therein concerned.</p>
               <p>XVI. A <hi>Drawer</hi> hath no leſs reaſon to be Angry with the <hi>Broger,</hi> if he without his Knowledge or Order, promiſe the <hi>Remitter any Time</hi> for the <hi>Payment</hi> of the Value.</p>
               <p>XVII. A <hi>Drawer</hi> is not obliged to make his Bills at <hi>ſhorter Sight</hi> or <hi>Time;</hi> nor is the the <hi>Remitter</hi> obliged to accept of Bills made at a <hi>longer Time of Payment,</hi> or on any other Perſon than was agreed on by the <hi>Mackeler</hi> or <hi>Broger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. Its the Duty of the <hi>Broger</hi> to maintain the Credit and Reputation of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> as much as he can (if it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60840:18"/>to his Knowledge) But it is not adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for him to oblige himſelf for his Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, which ſome <hi>Brogers,</hi> for Covetouſneſs of the <hi>Courtagie,</hi> have too late Repented of.</p>
               <p>XIX. Unknown Bills of young Beginners, or of thoſe that ſeldom frequent the Exchange (who may be ſufficient enough) a <hi>Broger</hi> may freely offer; but it greatly tends to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition of his Credit, if he ordinarily offer Bills of thoſe that are known to be of little Repute or Credit, eſpecially if he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them; yea, it is perfect Knavery in him to draw for any man, whoſe Bills he knows will not be anſwered, or remit for any, who he knows cannot pay the Value.</p>
               <p>XX. <hi>Brogers</hi> muſt diligently guard againſt <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Cheating.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXI. A wiſe Merchant will not credit again that <hi>Broger</hi> that hath once Cheated him.</p>
               <p>XXII. A wiſe Merchant will not ſuffer himſelf by the Inſinuations of <hi>Mackelers</hi> or <hi>Brogers,</hi> to be ſeduced, in hopes of great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to act any thing contrary to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, or the Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>XXIII. He that by a <hi>Letter of Attorney,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60840:18"/>or full Power, will draw in another's Name, is Bound expreſly to ſignifie ſo much to the <hi>Broger,</hi> and the <hi>Broger</hi> muſt conclude the Parcel in the Name of the <hi>Principal,</hi> not in the Name of the <hi>Perſon that hath the Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIV. The Merchants, both the <hi>Drawer</hi> and the <hi>Remitter,</hi> will before they conclude finally and abſolutely, enquire of the <hi>Broger</hi> of the ſufficiency of each other; and it is the <hi>Brogers</hi> Duty to inform them as well as he can.</p>
               <p>XXV. When an Exchange is concluded, by the help and aſſiſtance of the <hi>Broger,</hi> it cannot be repented of, without the conſent of the Party, and the <hi>Brogers</hi> Courtagie muſt be paid him; beſides, it reflects upon either of them, to fly from their Words.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the</hi> Courſe <hi>of</hi> Exchange.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IN treating about, or Negotiating of a <hi>Bill of Exchange,</hi> the <hi>Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> will ſeek to conclude for his moſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; but the <hi>Drawer</hi> muſt have reſpect to his Credit, and not draw, but at an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Courſe.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60840:19"/>
               <p>II. It is not poſſible that the <hi>Drawer</hi> ſhould alwayes get the very heighth of the Courſe, nor are all Bills of one and the ſame Courſe; but according to the Plenty or Scarcity of Monyes, or Bills, the Courſe alters in a little time; wherefore Merchants muſt be curious and exact in concluding an Exchange.</p>
               <p>III. When there is plenty of Money and ſcarcity of Bills, then the <hi>Drawer</hi> may hold hard, and delay to conclude; but if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and if he muſt needs draw, let him not neglect nor delay.</p>
               <p>IV. In the concluding of a <hi>Bill of Exchange,</hi> if the <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Brogers</hi> only treat about the Courſe, not mentioning any other Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then the other Conditions are ſuppoſed to be ſuch, as the Cuſtom of the Place, to which the Bill muſt be directed, ordinarily allows of, not only in reſpect of the Time of Payment, and the Species in which the Bill muſt be paid, but in all other reſpects.</p>
               <p>V. He that will remit or draw at longer or ſhorter time, or will pay or receive other Species of Monyes, &amp;c. than are uſual and cuſtomary at the Places where the Exchange is concluded, or the Bill to be paid, he muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he conclude, expreſly condition for ſuch things.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60840:19"/>
               <p>VI. <hi>Exchange</hi> is performed either in a <hi>Domeſtick</hi> or <hi>Forreign Coyn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. In a <hi>Domeſtick Coyn,</hi> when the Bill muſt be paid in the ſame Sort &amp; Species of Monyes, that the Remitter paid to the Drawer for the Value; and theſe are uſually <hi>Inland Bills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. In a <hi>Forreign,</hi> when the Bill is paid in another Species and Coyn, than the Drawer received; and ſo are uſually all <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. In all Exchanges, the <hi>Coyns</hi> in one place, as well as another, are Certain and Immutable; and the change of the Courſe, either higher or lower, depends upon the <hi>preſent Value of the Coyn</hi> in the Place where the Bill is directed to.</p>
               <p>X. It is then called <hi>[Pari]</hi> when Money for Monyes is Exchanged, receiving neither more nor leſs in Value, than the Value recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved was.</p>
               <p>XI. The <hi>Drawer</hi> is ſaid to Exchange with Advantage, when he concludes for a Courſe that is above <hi>[Pari.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. The <hi>Remitter</hi> is ſaid to Exchange
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60840:20"/>with Advantage, when he payes the <hi>Drawer</hi> leſs than the <hi>[Pari.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. He that remits his Monyes, in hopes of Advantage, doth not always advance by his Remiſes.</p>
               <p>XIV. The Exchange of Monyes from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Antwerp, Amſterdam, Rotterdam,</hi> &amp;c. is made upon the Pound Sterling of 20 <hi>
                     <abbr>s.</abbr> viz.</hi> they give ſo many Shillings Flemiſh for a Pound Sterling; <hi>Hamborough</hi> the ſame.</p>

               <p>The Exchange to <hi>Venice</hi> is made upon the Ducat; and to <hi>Legorne</hi> upon the Ducat Piece of Eight.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the</hi> Reduction <hi>of</hi> Exchanges.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. THe Value of a <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> is reckoned by reducing the known into the deſired Sum of Moneys, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Courſe agreed upon.</p>
               <p>II. In Exchanges, ſometimes the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are for Moneys of one and the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations and Species, and ſometimes of different.</p>
               <p>III. When Exchanges are made for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of one and the ſame Denomination and Species, then uſually the Contract runs at ſo much the Hundred either Profit or Loſs.</p>
               <p>IV. And when it is thus concluded on, then it is certain, that as much as the one gaineth, the other looſeth upon every Hundred.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60840:21"/>
               <p>V. When an Exchange is concluded for Moneys of different Denominations, then the Courſe is made ſometimes in a <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> ſometimes in a <hi>Forreign Denomination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. To calculate the <hi>Pari</hi> of an Exchange, in drawing and remitting <hi>(na Ravaglie)</hi> at a certain limitted Price, this only is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that when we are forced to draw at a diſadvantagious Courſe, we muſt remit at ſo much the more proportionably advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courſe; and when we cannot remit, but at an Unprofitable Courſe, we muſt ſee to make ſo much the more Profit by the Draught.</p>
               <p>VII. If any order his Correſpondent to remit Moneys to another place, where he hath occaſion for it, and to draw the Value upon himſelf, and will calculate to how much the Remiſe will ſtand him, he muſt add to the Principal Sum, the Proviſion for his <hi>Factor,</hi> and Courtagie for the <hi>Broger,</hi> which is, for the Factor, half <hi>per Cent,</hi> for the Broger, one <hi>per Mille,</hi> uſually.</p>
               <p>VIII. If any will calculate whether it be more profitable to order his Correſpondent to draw upon him directly, or by ſome other way indirectly and about, he muſt alſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60840:21"/>conſider, that he hath both <hi>Proviſion</hi> and <hi>Courtagie</hi> to pay to his Correſpondent, whom he orders to accept, in caſe he be ordered to Revalue the ſame; but if he remit to his Correſpondent, then there is only Proviſion, and no Courtagie due; yet the <hi>Courtagie</hi> muſt be conſidered in the <hi>Calculation,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Principal</hi> himſelf hath paid it.</p>
               <p>IX. If any will calculate, whether it be more Profitable to let his Effects be remitted directly, or by ſome other wayes about, he muſt obſerve, beſides the Calculation and Equalling of the reſpective Courſes to and fro, if the Remiſes are not made directly to himſelf, that he hath double or tribble <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi> and <hi>Courtagie</hi> to allow, and will loſe a conſiderable time before he get his Moneys; but if the Remiſe be direct, or he himſelf, draw his Moneys in, he hath but ſingle Courtagie and Proviſion to pay or allow.</p>
               <p>X. To calculate the Profit or Loſs of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and a redrawn Remiſe, the Profit muſt be diminiſhed, or the Loſs augmented, with double Courtagie, <hi>viz. for the Draught,</hi> and <hi>for the Remiſe;</hi> and when any will caculate what is loſt or profited by a Remiſe, that is now returned, or to be returned, they muſt from the Sum remitted, that is elſe-where to be received, ſubſtract the Proviſion and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60840:22"/>Courtagie, and the Remainder is the <hi>Apoinctee</hi> (the <hi>Neat Sum</hi>) which muſt be reduced accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Courſe of Exchange; and then they have the Product of the Rechange: Let this be compared with the Sum that was firſt remitted, having added the Charges thereof thereto, and then it will eaſily appear, what the Profit or the Loſs was by that Negotiation.</p>
               <p>XI. In Calculating, according to Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how much by the hundred is gained or loſt by Exchanges in a Year, in Remiſes, we cannot alwayes ſtrictly account of the time, ſeeing its ſeldom that the day of Payment, and the Expiration of the Term of the Bill meet together, nor can the Moneys received be alwayes again remitted the ſame day; but in drawing, the Time may be preciſely accounted of and calculated, becauſe Draughts moſt times, before, and at fartheſt, on the laſt day of the Term are again Re-valued.</p>
               <p>XII. If a <hi>Factor</hi> be drawn upon, with order to re-draw the Value again on the Principal, or elſe-where, he muſt charge the Value of the Draught with his Proviſion and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagie, and the Product is the <hi>Neat Sum,</hi> that he muſt charge him with. On the contrary, when a Factor hath Moneys remitted to him, with orders to remit the ſame to ſome other
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60840:22"/>Place, he muſt from the Sum remitted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct his Proviſion and Courtagie, and the Remander is the <hi>Neat Sum,</hi> that he muſt remit. So alſo, when a Factor is ordered to remit to one Place, and to value on another, he muſt firſt remit, and then to the Sum remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, add his Proviſion and double Courtagie, and then he receives the Sum he disburſed. But if he firſt have drawn a certain Sum, and then will reckon how much he hath to Remit, then he muſt from the Sum drawn, deduct his Proviſion and double Courtagie, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander is the <hi>Neat Sum</hi> that he muſt Remit; which Sum, if the Exchange be made in a Forreign Denomination of Coyn, muſt be reduced according to the Courſe agreed on, to the Value of that Coyn that muſt be expreſt in the <hi>Bills of Exchange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. Proviſion muſt as often be reckoned in the Calculation, as it is Exchanged or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or turned over; but the Courtagie is allowed to no Factor, unleſs he do actually Negotiate the ſame, either by Drawing or Remitting.</p>
               <p>XIV. In Calculating the Charges of Bills of Exchange, that are proteſted for Non-Payment, the Courſe of the Re-change is reckoned, as it were, the Day, or the Poſt day after or before the Bill of Exchange was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60840:23"/>Proteſted, at the Place where it was proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the Place whence it came, at ſight, and to the Sum is added, half <hi>per Pound</hi> for Proviſion, one <hi>per Mille</hi> for Courtagie, the Charges of the Proteſt, and the Poſtidge of Letters.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. THe <hi>Drawer</hi> is obliged to give to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, Bills</hi> for the Sum Negotiated.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Drawer</hi> ought to obſerve, before he ſubſcribe the Bill, at leaſt, before he part with it, and the <hi>Remitter</hi> before he receive it, at leaſt, before he ſend it to the Poſt, or if he redraw the Value, before he endorſe it, or part with it out of his hands, if it be well and truly made, and all the neceſſary Requiſits fully expreſt in it.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60840:23"/>
               <p>III. A Bill of Exchange is an obligatory Writing, containing, (1.) a Time When, (2.) the Place Where the ſame is diſpatched, (3.) the Sum, (4.) agreed on, and ordered, (5.) at a certain Day, (6.) To whom it muſt be paid, (7.) From whom (8.) the Value is received, (9.) ſubſcribed by the Drawer, with a Superſcription (10.) to him that ſhall pay it, and ſatisfie it, and (11.) the Place where it ſhall be ſatisfied. Theſe are the Requiſits of a Bill of Exchange.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>1ſt,</hi> Both the Parties muſt obſerve, that the Bill be rightly dated and clearly expreſt.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>2dly,</hi> That it name the Place where it was made and concluded on.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>3dly,</hi> That the Sum be expreſt ſo clearly, both in Words and Figures, that no Exceptions can be taken againſt it.</p>

               <p>VIII. <hi>5thly,</hi> That the time of Payment be not dubiouſly expreſt, nor neither ſooner nor later than the time agreed on.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60840:24"/>
               <p>IX. <hi>6thly,</hi> The <hi>Remitter</hi> muſt eſpecially obſerve, that the Name of the Perſon to whom Payment muſt be made, be well and truly Spelled; or if it be made to his Order, that thoſe words be clearly writ.</p>
               <p>X. <hi>7thly, 8thly,</hi> He muſt alſo obſerve if his Name be therein, and the Value of him be expreſt.</p>
               <p>XI. <hi>9thly,</hi> He muſt obſerve, that the Bill be under-writ by the <hi>Drawer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. <hi>10thly,</hi> The <hi>Drawer</hi> muſt principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look to the Direction and Superſcription of the Bill, that it be well and truly made, and directed to the right man.</p>
               <p>XIII. <hi>11thly,</hi> They muſt both obſerve, that the Place wherein the Payment muſt be made (and the Coyn or Species wherein it muſt be paid) be fully expreſt in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, or in the Body of the Bill: And if a <hi>Drawer</hi> draw upon one that lives not at the place where the Payment muſt be made, then muſt the <hi>Remitter</hi> obſerve, that as well the Place where the Perſon that muſt pay liveth, as the place where the Payment muſt be made, be expreſt.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60840:24"/>
               <p>XIV. Here follows the Form of a Bill of Exchange.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>

               </floatingText>
               <p>XV. Sometimes it falls out, that but one <hi>Sola</hi> Bill of Exchange is made for one Parcel, but ordinarily, eſpecially when the Places are of any conſiderable Diſtance, two, and ſometimes three muſt be made, and the firſt is called <hi>Prima,</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Secunda, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVI. A <hi>Remitter</hi> deals imprudently when he requires or accepts of one <hi>Sola</hi> Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for one Parcel, though it be to be paid upon ſight, if the Place of Payment be of any Diſtance conſiderable, from the place where the Contract was made.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60840:25"/>
               <p>XVII. The <hi>Drawer</hi> is obliged to give the <hi>Remitter</hi> as many ſeveral Bills of Exchange as the <hi>Remitter</hi> deſires, and to proportion the Sums, according as the <hi>Remitter</hi> requires; on the contrary, the <hi>Remitter</hi> is obliged to receive as many Bills from the <hi>Drawer,</hi> and to furniſh him with ſo much Moneys as the Sum agreed on will amount to.</p>
               <p>XVIII. The <hi>Drawer</hi> deals imprudently when he makes more Bills of Exchange than one, for one and the ſame Sum, and of one and the ſame Import. And in caſe the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter</hi> require of him thus much, then let him make one Bill for the Sum the <hi>Remitter</hi> deſires, and let him for the other Sum make two Bills, all amounting to the deſired Sum, <hi>i.e.</hi> If the <hi>Remitter</hi> would have two 500 Dollar Bills at one time, let the <hi>Drawer</hi> make one 500 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Bill, and divide the other 500 Dollars into two Bills.</p>
               <p>XIX. The <hi>Drawer</hi> muſt eſpecially obſerve, that for one and the ſame Parcel of Moneys, he make not two <hi>Prima's</hi> or two <hi>Secunda's,</hi> but he muſt obſerve to diſtinguiſh them clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well in the Body of the Bill, as on the Superſcription.</p>
               <p>XX. Its Prudence in a <hi>Drawer,</hi> when the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60840:25"/>
                  <hi>Remitter</hi> requires a <hi>Secunda Bill,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Drawer</hi> is not certain whether he hath given him a <hi>Secunda</hi> or not, to make a Third or <hi>Tertia</hi> Bill inſtead of a <hi>Secunda,</hi> and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a <hi>Tertia</hi> a <hi>Quarta,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>XXI. The <hi>Drawer</hi> muſt alſo obſerve, that all the Bills that are for one and the ſame Parcel, muſt bear one and the ſame date, and muſt be in every reſpect alike; only with this difference, that one is the <hi>Prima,</hi> another the <hi>Secunda,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>XXII. A <hi>Drawer</hi> may direct his Bills to whom he pleaſeth, that hath Authority, and is obliged to accept them, and by the acceptance obligeth himſelf, yea, on his own Servant, whom he maintains abroad.</p>
               <p>XXIII. A wiſe <hi>Drawer</hi> will make no Bills payable at ſight, nor at ſo many Dayes, Weeks or Moneths after the ſight.</p>
               <p>XXIV. Neither ſhall he, if he can any way void it, make any Bills payable to him, on whom he draws, unleſs he be abundantly ſatisfied of his Sufficiency and Faithfulneſs.</p>
               <p>XXV. The <hi>Drawer</hi> is obliged to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the <hi>Remitter,</hi> by altering the Bills when he requires it (though already made
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60840:26"/>according to his order) either by dividing the Sums, or making them payable to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in caſe no man elſe hath endorſed them, if the <hi>Remitter</hi> will be at the Charges of Poſtidge of the Letters, &amp;c. but if the Bills be accepted or endorſed, the <hi>Drawer</hi> muſt be very cautious in altering any thing.</p>
               <p>XXVI. A cautious Drawer will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to change or alter in both or all the Bills, what he changeth or altereth in one.</p>
               <p>XXVII. No <hi>Remitter</hi> is obliged to receive any <hi>Bills</hi> from the <hi>Drawer,</hi> which are made payable by the <hi>Drawer</hi> himſelf, except at the great <hi>Marts</hi> and <hi>Fairs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXVIII. When in the concluding of a Parcel, the Broger expreſly promiſeth to the Remitter, that the Drawer ſhall deliver him Bills, that are drawn, endorſed or accepted by a known ſufficient man; then the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not obliged to receive the Drawers own Bills, nor unaccepted Bills, nor any other Bills that are only endorſed by the Drawer.</p>
               <p>XXIX. A Remitter muſt be cautious in accepting or receiving of accepted Bills of Exchange, which are made payable to the Order of the Drawer, and endorſed by him, unleſs he knew the Drawer to be ſufficient.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60840:26"/>
               <p>XXX. He muſt alſo be cautious of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Bills that are made, drawn or accepted by a known ſufficient man, whoſe Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting he knows, if the Endorſer or the Drawer in of the Value be an unknown Man.</p>
               <p>XXXI. A Remitter that muſt have Bills Payable at ſight, is not obliged to receive Bills whoſe term of Payment are nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, or will in probability be expired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bills can arrive at the place of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if he be blameable at any time for this, its then moſt of all, when he knows the Poſt is very uncertain, by reaſon of the badneſs of the wayes, or other Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, unleſs the Drawer will ſufficiently warrant and enſure him, though Payment ſhould not be demanded before the Term was wholly expired.</p>
               <p>XXXII. <hi>Marius</hi>'s Advice is, that the <hi>Drawer</hi> when he hath made his Bill, ſhould make the Direction on the inſide of it towards the left Hand, that there may be more room for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſment, and for a Receit or Acquittance.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. He adviſeth alſo, That if it can well be avoided, that never any Bills ſhould be made Payable to the Bearer, nor to any one Perſon, naming his Name (but <hi>To him, or his Order</hi>) for both theſe wayes are dangerous.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60840:27"/>
               <p>XXXIV. The ſame <hi>Marius</hi> adds a Caſe, which I believe ſeldom happens, <hi>viz.</hi> That both the <hi>Drawer</hi> ſhould forget to direct, and the <hi>Remitter</hi> not take notice that ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was wanting, yet in this caſe he ſayes, If the Remitter adviſe his Correſpondent, on whom it was drawn, the Poſſeſſor may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Acceptance, and in Caſe of Refuſal, Proteſt, and recover the Charges of the Drawer, againſt whom he Proteſts; yet in this caſe alſo, if the Acceptant have a Letter of Advice, deſiring him to accept, and he have in hands to anſwer with, he may ſafely accept, though the Bill be not directed; but the Drawer, for his Error ought to be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and that by a Proteſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. EVery Individual, that is concerned in a Bill of Exchange, is obliged to place ſo much to Book as he is concerned in it.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60840:27"/>
               <p>II. A Drawer muſt place to Book exactly and diſtinctly the Contents and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of every Bill, before he make the Bills, or at leaſt, before he deliver them to the Broger or Remitter, he muſt note, <hi>The Day When, The Place Whither, The Perſons, By Whom,</hi> and <hi>To Whom Payable, For Whoſe Accounts, From Whom the Value, The Time when to be Paid, The Sum,</hi> and <hi>the Courſe,</hi> &amp;c. that ſo, if at any time ſecond, third or fourth Bills ſhould be demanded, they may all of them be made alike.</p>
               <p>III. The Remitter ſhould as ſoon as he receives the Bills, place them to Book, at leaſt, before he pay the Value to the Drawer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he effectually Remit, or deſign to Redraw the Value again.</p>
               <p>IV. When the Remitter receives not the Drawer's own Bills, but Bills endorſed by him, he ought narrowly to obſerve, <hi>What Date they bear, From What Place they come,</hi> and <hi>By Whom they were firſt made, The Sum they are for,</hi> and <hi>When to be Paid,</hi> and <hi>To Whom to be Paid, The Courſe that he agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>To Whom the Bill is Endorſed;</hi> and then it will manifeſtly appear to him, if there be any Deceit or Abuſe in the Endorſing of it, or any other Defect.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60840:28"/>
               <p>V. The Drawer and Remitter ſhould alſo in ſome convenient place in the Book, note the <hi>Mackelers</hi> or <hi>Brogers</hi> Name to every Parcel, that in caſe of any Diſpute or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency (as alſo the better to account with the Broger) they may know with what Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they concluded.</p>
               <p>VI. A Remitter that does not effectually Remit, but deſigns his Moneys to be Re-drawn, and therefore orders the Bills to be made Payable to himſelf, or Order, would do well, at the ſide, or under every Parcel, to expreſs the very Day of Payment, and beſides, leave the ſpace of an Inch or more, that ſo he may note under it, <hi>When he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew it,</hi> or <hi>Tranſported it, To Whom,</hi> and <hi>By Whom Endorſed,</hi> and <hi>From Whom the Value, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. When the Remitter ſends his Bill to any, to demand Acceptance, he ought to note, near the Parcel entred in his Exchange-Book, <hi>When,</hi> and <hi>To Whom he ſent it,</hi> and <hi>When he receives it again accepted;</hi> then may he cancel the former.</p>
               <p>VIII. And when Bills are ſent to any, to procure Acceptance, with order to detain them, till the ſame, with the Endorſed, be demanded, this ought alſo carefully to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60840:28"/>Booked; and he that receives ſuch a Bill ſhould alſo obſerve, and note, <hi>From Whence he received it,</hi> and <hi>To Whom he delivered it;</hi> he ought alſo to obſerve, <hi>The Day of Payment,</hi> that in caſe the ſecond or endorſed Bill come not in time, he may by Virtue of the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bill ſolliciate the Payment, by offering ſufficient Caution to the Accepter, or <hi>(Namptiſeren)</hi> deſire him to pay the ſaid Moneys to the Magiſtrates, by them to be kept, or proteſt in caſe of Refuſal.</p>
               <p>IX. So ſoon as any receives a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, at leaſt, before he demand Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he ought to Book it, and Note, <hi>From Whence it came, By Whom brought, For Whoſe Account, In Whoſe Letter, Of What Date, For What Sum, By Whoſe Order, When, and to Whom Payable;</hi> and in like manner, when it is an Endorſed, or a Re-drawn Bill, he muſt obſerve, <hi>When and Where it was firſt concluded,</hi> and <hi>How, and by Whom it came Endorſed to him;</hi> and if the Parcel were remitted to him for his own Account, he muſt note the Courſe it was done at, and for how much he muſt Credit his Correſpondent for it.</p>
               <p>X. When the Letter of Advice expreſſeth, That the Bill is to be paid to the <hi>Remitter,</hi> or his (or any other Order) the <hi>Acceptant</hi> ought to leave a ſpace in his Book, where he notes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60840:29"/>the Parcel to note, by whom it was preſented to be accepted, and when the Payment muſt be made: If he find Endorſement upon En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſement, before the Payment be made, he ought to ſpecifie all the Endorſements in his Books, beſides the Parcel, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till he come to the Perſon to whom the Payment is made.</p>
               <p>XI. The <hi>Acceptant</hi> ought alſo curiouſly to obſerve, and note under the Parcel, that, and when he accepted the Bill, that if the <hi>Drawer</hi> hath been negligent or miſtaken, and hath made two or more divers Bills of the ſame Tenure, for one and the ſame Sum payable to order, the <hi>Acceptant</hi> may be cautious in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, and muſt not only note the Endorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if any be found on the Bills that are preſented for Acceptance, but alſo narrowly obſerve, whether he accepted the firſt or the ſecond Bill, and note it in his Book, leſt he ſhould accept two divers Bills for one and the ſame Sum.</p>
               <p>XII. The <hi>Acceptant</hi> ſhould, ſo ſoon as he gets Advice, that his Correſpondent hath drawn upon him, note the ſame in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, viz. <hi>From What Place, By Whom, What Sum, What Date, At What Time,</hi> and <hi>To Whom, or Whoſe Order the Bill is made Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi> and ſo in caſe the Bill be for his own
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60840:29"/>account, he muſt note in his Book, <hi>The Courſe it was drawn at, and the Sum for which he muſt Debit him;</hi> and this he ſhould do, <hi>extempore,</hi> not waiting till the Bill be preſented for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, or Payment be demanded.</p>
               <p>XIII. Though it be not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, yet it is not reproveable, if the Perſon on whom a Bill is drawn, ſhould note in his Memorial, even thoſe Bills that he ſuffers to be proteſted for Non-Acceptance; but then he muſt alſo add, that he ſuffered them to be proteſted for Non-Acceptance.</p>
               <p>XIV. He that hath a Bill of Exchange in Poſſeſſion, which was not accepted, or not at the due time paid, though it was accepted, and ſo is proteſted for Non-Acceptance or Non Payment, muſt alſo note in his Memorial, underneath the Parcel, <hi>When, and to Whom he ſent the Proteſt, with or without the Bill of Exchange.</hi> And ſo, in caſe a third Perſon, or he himſelf accept, and pay the ſame Bill, in honour of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> or of any of the <hi>Endorſers,</hi> he ought diligently to note, and obſerve the ſame in his Memorial, with all the Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>XV. He that doth not Voluntarily, but <hi>ſupra</hi> proteſt, in honour of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> or any other Perſon, accept and pay a Bill, muſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60840:30"/>at the entring of the Parcel to Book, note, <hi>For Whoſe Account he accepted the ſame;</hi> and ſo when the Bill is drawn in, not on the <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> but on ſome other that ſuffered it to be proteſted, the Acceptant <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt muſt make a perfect and compleat Entry thereof, as if the Sum had directly been drawn upon him, to wit, <hi>When, By Whom, What Sum, To Whom, At What Time Payable,</hi> and <hi>On Whom it was drawn,</hi> and that he <hi>accepted the ſame</hi> ſupra <hi>Proteſt, in honour of the</hi> Drawer <hi>or ſome</hi> Endorſer.</p>
               <p>XVI. If a Bill be made payable ſome time after ſight, or at Uſance (if Uſance be reckoned after ſight) the Acceptant and the Poſſeſſor of the Bill, muſt enter in their Memorials, the date of the Acceptance, to calculate the day of Payment by; and it is a good and laudable Cuſtom in all Merchants, as well Acceptants as Poſſeſſors of Bills, to enter underneath, or at the ſide of the Entry of the Parcel, the day of its being due, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bill be payable after ſight, after date, or at uſance.</p>
               <p>XVII. If any receive Advice from his Factor, that his Factor hath drawn or remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his account, to ſome other Place, the Principal ſhould alſo note in his Memorial, and diſtinctly ſpecifie, <hi>By Whom, From Whence,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60840:30"/>To What Place, When, What Sum, At What Courſe, To Whom the ſame was remitted, or on Whom drawn, By What Letter, and of What Date he had Advice thereof;</hi> and when he gets further Confirmation thereof, he muſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerve, if the firſt and ſecond Advice agree, or not.</p>
               <p>XVIII. So alſo, when any draws or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, or is drawn on, or remitted to by his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, by order of a third, for account of a fourth, he alſo muſt in his Memorial, ſpecifie all at large, that the Book-keeper may know whom to debit, and whom to credit in the Journal.</p>
               <p>NB, <hi>The Entries that are here ſpoken of, in all the fore-mentioned Caſes, are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a formal Journal, or leidger Entry, but only of a plain Entry into the Waſte-Book or Memorial, either by the Merchant himſelf, or any of his Servants. And from all this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſufficiently, that a Merchant ought to be a diligent and careful Writer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. If any draw on his own account, upon time, or remit, or orders to be drawn or remitted on, or to his Correſpondent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in ſome other place, he ought to enter in his Memorial, <hi>When the ſame is Payable,</hi> that againſt that time he may make neceſſary
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60840:31"/>Proviſion for the Payment, or to order the further Diſpoſal of it, and to credit or debit his Correſpondent for the ſame in his Account currant.</p>
               <p>XX. He alſo on whom is drawn, or to whom is remitted, ſhould enter in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, <hi>The Time of Payment, To Whom, For What Bill, What Sum muſt be demanded, or be paid;</hi> and ſo when the Bill is made payable to order, the ſame muſt be expreſt, that the Poſſeſſer of the Bill, againſt that time, may adviſe the Acceptant, to whom the Bill is to be paid, or the Acceptant enquire, to whom its payable by the Poſſeſſor.</p>
               <p>XXI. When a Bill of Exchange is to be entred into the Journal, the Book-keeper muſt be careful to find out the true Debitor and Creditor; and if the Bill be for anothers account, he need but enter the ſame, that he receives in that Species, or denomination of Moneys, wherein he keeps his Books; but if the Bill be for his own account, then the Product muſt not only be entred in the Species and Denomination of Moneys, wherein he keeps his Book, but alſo in that Coyn and Species wherein he keeps an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with his Correſpondent; and in the poſting of the ſame into his great Book, or Leidger, the Forreign Coynes muſt be duely
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60840:31"/>expreſt in the Factors; <hi>My Account</hi> currant by him in the Lines, and the Domeſtick Coyns or Species in the places appointed for them, that ſo when he receives an account currant from his Factor, he may readily without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his Journal, compare every Parcel.</p>
               <p>XXII. It is a great error in ſome, when they have negotiated Bills for their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, to credit their Correſpondent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanly for the ſums they have drawn or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon time, as alſo for the principal to credit or debit the Correſpondents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count currant, when the Correſpondent hath drawn or remitted for his account, on time, ſo ſoon as he receives advice of its being done, though the Moneys is not to be paid or received till ſome Weeks or Moneths be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; for thereby the account currant, which ſhould alwayes be clear and demonſtrative, and ſhew how the account ſtands with the Correſpondent at all times, is rendred very obſcure and confuſed; wherefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Book-keeper enter all Parcels and Bills for proper Accounts, in a general entry, under the Title of <hi>Exchange-Accounts,</hi> or ſome other convenient Title, and at the time of their being due, or when the Moneys is really received or paid, then to tranſport them to their proper places. But if the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60840:32"/>Bills be remitted or drawn for anothers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then no entry need be made in the Journal at all, till the time of their being Paid or Received, and then is the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent's Account currant to be credited or debited accordingly.</p>
               <p>XXIII. <hi>Marius</hi>'s advice is, not only to note in a Book the Name and Place of abode of him that preſents a Bill to be accepted, but alſo to keep Cop es of the Bills that he accepts, and alſo adviſeth him that gets the Bill accepted, to keep a Copy thereof. But I can ſee no neceſſity hereof, if all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be ſo particularly expreſt in the Book.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Letters of Advice, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. EVery individual Perſon, that is any way concerned in a Bill of Exchange, muſt be very prompt, exact and quick in adviſing or returning of Anſwers.</p>
               <p>II. Above all things, its the duty of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> without delay, by the firſt Poſt, to give his Correſpondent, on whom he draws,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60840:32"/>advice thereof, that the Bill be not preſented for accep tance, before he hath advice thereof.</p>
               <p>III. The Letter of advice muſt be full and clear, containing all the Circumſtances of the Bill, as <hi>the Date, the Sum, for whoſe Account, to whom Payable,</hi> and <hi>of whom the Value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. If the Draught be for the account of the Drawer, or of a third Perſon, and not for account of the Acceptant, it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he adviſe the Acceptant of the courſe, ſeeing the Sum to be paid is expreſt in the Bill, in the denomination and ſpecies of Moneys that is well known at the Place where payment muſt be made; but if the ſum to be paid, be expreſt in a Forreign denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Moneys, then is it abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to adviſe of the courſe, according to which the Reduction muſt be made, as well as of the Sum drawn, let the Draught be for whoſe Account it will.</p>
               <p>V. The Drawer's Letter of Advice to his Correſpondent, on whom he draws, ſhould deſire him to take notice thereof, and to honour the Bill, when preſented with Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and when demanded with punctual Payment, and to Debit him for it, or to ſeek his Re-imburſement, if he draw for a third
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60840:33"/>Perſon, of him that gave the Order for his Acceptance of it.</p>
               <p>VI. Its alſo uſual for the Drawer by the following Poſt to confirm the Draught, &amp;c. and if the Bill be at ſhort ſight, and for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Sum, he would do well to give Advice thereof as many divers wayes as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he can.</p>
               <p>VII. He that Remits muſt alſo give his Correſpondent punctual Advice, <hi>For whoſe Account he Remits, what Sum, in whoſe Bill, of what Date, and when Payable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. If the Bill be not yet accepted, the Remitter ſhould deſire him to whom he remits, to procure the Acceptance, and for refuſal to obſerve the Cuſtom of Exchanges, <hi>i.e.</hi> to Proteſt.</p>
               <p>IX. If the accepted Bill be in the Hands of any (at the place where payment is to be made) that demanded Acceptance, and the unaccepted endorſed Bill doth not mention in whoſe Hands it is, then the Remitter ought in his Letter of Advice, to give notice by whom the accepted Bill lies.</p>
               <p>X. The Remitter muſt be careful to ſend his Bills to thoſe that will demand Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60840:33"/>and adviſe him to whom they are made payable, or endorſed, and ſhould be careful to incloſe ſuch Bills to no other, but to him that muſt demand Acceptance.</p>
               <p>XI. If the Remitter receive two Bills to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (i. e. <hi>prima &amp; ſecunda</hi>) for one and the ſame Sum, he muſt not incloſe them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Letter, nor ſend them in divers Letters by one Poſt; but ſend the one by one Poſt, and the other by the next, that if one miſcarry, or fall into wrong Hands, the other may be ſecured and ſent to the true Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, to demand Acceptance and Payment.</p>
               <p>XII. If the Remitter hath but one ſingle accepted Bill, or if the accepted Bill remain at the place where it ought to be diſcharged, and ſo the Remitter hath but one Bill to ſend, then its neceſſary that the Remiſe be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the following Poſt, and clearly and fully expreſt in a Letter of Advice, that if the Bill ſhould miſcarry, the Perſon to whom it was remitted, may by virtue of the Letter of Advice make his Addreſs to the Perſon, who ſhould have accepted and paid the Bill, and forbid him to pay any ſuch Bill to any Perſon but himſelf; and if none appear before the Day of Payment, he then may demand Payment of it by virtue of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60840:34"/>Letter of Advice, and perſwade him to pay the Moneys to him upon caution, &amp;c. or on refuſal hereof, Proteſt againſt him.</p>
               <p>XIII. A Remitter or Drawer, for the account of a third, muſt alſo give punctual and full Advice to him for whoſe Account a Bill is drawn or remitted, adding alſo the Courſe, and for how much he hath Debited or Credited his Account.</p>
               <p>XIV. Its the Duty of the Acceptant, to return an Anſwer to the Drawer, whether he will accept of the Bill, when preſented, according to the Letter of Advice he hath received; and if he make any difficulty about the Acceptance, he ought ſpeedlly to give the Drawer advice thereof, and not to wait till the Bill be returned with Proteſt.</p>
               <p>XV. He that accepts a Bill <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, whether it be the firſt deſigned Acceptant or not, he muſt ſpeedily, without delay, give advice thereof to him in whoſe honour he accepted it, and ſend him therewith the Proteſt.</p>
               <p>XVI. If the deſigned Acceptant accept it but <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> its not neceſſary that the Poſſeſſor of the Bill adviſe the Remitter thereof; but if the Acceptance be made by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60840:34"/>another, then its beſt to adviſe him, that it was accepted <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> and by whom.</p>
               <p>XVII. He on whom is drawn, for the account of a third, muſt alſo give an account to him for whoſe account it is, <hi>By whom, What Sum, and at what Time Payable is drawn upon him, and whether he hath or will honour the Bills for his Account or not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. The Perſon to whom is remitted muſt alſo adviſe him, <hi>For whoſe account is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, of the Remiſe, and of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Circumſtances;</hi> and <hi>whether the Bills are or will be accepted or not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. If no punctual Advice can be given, whether the Bills will be accepted or not, becauſe the Acceptant is abroad, lives not in Town, cannot be met with, or is ſuſpected, and cannot be found, &amp;c. the remitted ought to give Advice hereof to the Remitter, and to him for whoſe account it is; and if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it be accepted, he muſt adviſe them both, <hi>That it is accepted;</hi> yet this laſt Advice may be ſpared, if the fuſt Advice be full and clear, expreſſing, <hi>That Acceptance will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;</hi> and if not accepted, <hi>The Perſons concerned may expect to hear of a Protest;</hi> ſo that if the next Poſt bring no Proteſt, they may both conclude, that the Bill is accepted.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60840:35"/>
               <p>XX. If a Bill be not accepted, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, then the Proteſter is obliged to give Advice thereof to the Remitter, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and ſhould ſend him the Proteſt. And in caſe the Bill be payable to order, and comes Originally from ſome other place, than whence he received it, the <hi>Proteſter</hi> doth act prudently, if he adviſe the firſt Remitter thereof.</p>
               <p>XXI. When a Bill is diſcharged and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, for whoſe account ſoever it be, its the Duty of the Payer and Receiver, each of them to adviſe thoſe that are concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, reſpectively, except the Draught or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be for the account of the Acceptant, or the Remitted, then its not uſual, though very convenient it would be, to give advice of the Diſcharge thereof.</p>
               <p>XXII. If any give order to draw upon a third Perſon, for his account, he ought at the ſame time to adviſe the third Perſon, <hi>That he hath given ſuch order,</hi> and <hi>to whom,</hi> and <hi>for what Sum,</hi> and deſire him to accept the Bills of his Correſpondent; and ſignifie to him, <hi>how he muſt place it to Account,</hi> or be <hi>Re-imburſed,</hi> by redrawing, &amp;c. This he muſt do, leſt the <hi>Bills</hi> be drawn before the third Perſon have order from the Principal to accept them.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60840:35"/>
               <p>XXIII. He that is fore-adviſed, that he will be drawn upon, ought inſtantly to return an Anſwer, whether he hath taken notice thereof, and will accept and honour the <hi>Bills,</hi> or not.</p>
               <p>XXIV. In like manner, if any give order to another, to remit for his account, to a third, he muſt alſo adviſe the ſame third Perſon, before the Remiſes come to his hands, that he hath given ſuch orders (eſpecially if the ſame are to be made at ſhort ſight) and how he will have them diſpoſed of; and its the Duty of this third Perſon to return an Anſwer, <hi>That he hath received, and will, or will not obſerve his orders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXV. If a Factor, Correſpondent, or Principal, &amp;c. adviſe his principal Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent or Factor, <hi>That he will accept ſuch and ſuch Draughts, for ſuch and ſuch Accounts,</hi> but afterwards refuſeth to accept thoſe <hi>Bills,</hi> and returns them on the Drawer with <hi>Proteſt,</hi> it is but juſt and equal, that he that promiſed acceptance, and refuſed it, ſhould be oliged to make good all the Loſs, whatever it be, and make ſatisfaction for the Damage done to the Credit of the Drawer.</p>
               <p>XXVI. If the <hi>Letter of Advice</hi> diſagree
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60840:36"/>with the <hi>Bill,</hi> in reſpect of the Sum, or the Sum expreſt in Figures in the <hi>Bill,</hi> with the Sum expreſt at length in the body of the <hi>Bill,</hi> yet that ſum is to be followed that is expreſt at length, according to <hi>Marius</hi> his Advice; and if the Accepter will not accept for that Sum, the Poſſeſſor may and muſt Proteſt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Payment of the Value by the <hi>Remitter</hi> to the <hi>Drawer.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IN Exchanging, Credit muſt be given; but the <hi>Drawer</hi> had need obſerve to whom he gives credit, that he give not his Bills to him that cannot or will not pay the value; and the <hi>Remitter</hi> had need obſerve, whom he credits, that he give not his Moneys to one that cannot or will not pay the Bills: ſo that the one as well as the other, muſt be careful, and enquire into each others Sufficiency.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Bills</hi> are ſometimes given by one, who himſelf will diſcharge them; ſometimes are charged on a Debtor, who is to diſcharge them: Whereof afterwards ſhall be ſpoken.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:60840:36"/>
               <p>III. The value of a <hi>Bill</hi> is ordinarily paid in ready Moneys; and if the Drawer be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with any thing elſe, it is reckoned for, and as ready Moneys.</p>
               <p>IV. All <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> that are nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated or concluded at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> (or any other place where a <hi>Bank</hi> is erected) are payable in Bank, if they exceed a certain limitted Sum, upon Penalty, that ſuch Bills exceeding that Sum, not paid in <hi>Bank,</hi> ſhall be adjudged as not ſatisfied, and of forfeiture of a certain Sum to the Bank, beſides by thoſe that act contrarily; nor muſt the <hi>Brogers</hi> ſuffer themſelves to be employed about any <hi>Bills</hi> exceeding that Sum, to be payable out of <hi>Bank,</hi> or to act any thing to defraud or evade the ſaid Statute and Order, by dividing the ſums and leſſening them, that they may be made payable out of <hi>Bank,</hi> upon penalty of incurring the hazard of being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended and deprived of their Office and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB,</hi> It is but reaſonable and equal, that in all places, where a <hi>Bank</hi> is erected, all Bills ſhould be paid in <hi>Bank;</hi> and ſo long as there was no difference betwixt Bank and Currant Moneys, this order was obſerved at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> &amp;c. but in regard now at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> &amp;c. there is three or four in the hundred dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60840:37"/>betwixt Bank and Currant Moneys, in reſpect of the Value, therefore it is ſcarce practicable now for Merchants and Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers to obſerve this order, eſpecially for thoſe that have their Correſpondence in the chief Cities of <hi>Holland, Weſtphalia,</hi> in <hi>Swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Denmark,</hi> or other places on the <hi>Baltique Sea,</hi> ſeeing all Bills to thoſe places are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded for, and in currant Moneys, becauſe thoſe that are Inhabitants in other places, are only indebted to their Creditors in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> currant Moneys, and do know of no <hi>Aggio</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p-Moneys,</hi> and would alwayes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be cheated or over-reached, if any thing of this nature ſhould be impoſed upon them; but by erecting a Bank currant, this inconvenience might be prevented.</p>
               <p>V. Notwithſtanding, that ordinarily in Bills of Exchange, its ſaid, that the Value is received already, yet ordinarily the Value is not paid by the <hi>Remitter</hi> to the <hi>Drawer,</hi> till two or three dayes after the Delivery of the firſt <hi>Bill,</hi> and may in time enough be paid by the <hi>Remitter,</hi> at any time betwixt and the next Poſt.</p>
               <p>VI. But a <hi>Remitter</hi> muſt not, cannot delay the <hi>Drawer</hi> any longer than till the next Poſt, unleſs it were expreſly conditioned, that ſome time ſhould be given for the Payment of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60840:37"/>the Value; if he do, then may the <hi>Drawer</hi> forbid the Payment of his <hi>Bills,</hi> and demand ſatisfaction of the <hi>Remitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. If a <hi>Remitter</hi> condition for time, for the Payment of the Value, till he hath advice of the Acceptance of the <hi>Bills,</hi> then is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he make thoſe conditions with the <hi>Drawer</hi> himſelf, and not relie on the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Broger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. If a <hi>Remitter</hi> hath conditioned, not to pay the Value, till he hath advice of the Acceptance, he is (if the <hi>Bill</hi> be proteſted for Non-Acceptance) not obliged to pay the Value; but if it be accepted, though but by one, whoſe ſufficiency is ſuſpected, yet he is bound to pay the Value.</p>
               <p>IX. The Payment of the Value of a <hi>Bill,</hi> drawn by <hi>A.</hi> as having a Procuration or full Power from <hi>B.</hi> muſt not be made to <hi>A.</hi> but muſt in <hi>Bank</hi> be writ to the account of <hi>B.</hi> as the Principal <hi>Drawer;</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to make his full Power appear, and ſo in the Name of the Principal muſt receive the Value, and diſcharge the <hi>Remitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. A prudent <hi>Remitter</hi> will not pay the Value of a <hi>Bill,</hi> but upon an Aſſignation or Acquittance from the <hi>Drawer,</hi> expreſly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60840:38"/>
                  <hi>That the ſame is in Payment of the Value of ſuch a Bill;</hi> and this is to be obſerved as well in the Payment by <hi>Bank,</hi> as in <hi>currant Moneys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. A prudent <hi>Remitter</hi> will not offer to pay by Caſh, or in currant Moneys, what he is obliged to pay in <hi>Bank,</hi> without Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Aſſignation, becauſe ſuch Payment is not ſatisfactory, and contrary to order.</p>
               <p>XII. If the Value of a <hi>Bill,</hi> either in <hi>Bank</hi> or <hi>Currant Moneys,</hi> be paid to the <hi>Drawer,</hi> by any other than the <hi>Remitter,</hi> for the <hi>Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s account, or by his Order, in caſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not that ſuch Monyes is paid to the <hi>Drawer,</hi> upon the <hi>Remitter's</hi> account, and by his order; the <hi>Drawer</hi> would act very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and prudently, if he demanded a Note under the Payer's hand, ſignifying, <hi>By whoſe Order,</hi> and <hi>For whoſe account he makes ſuch Payment.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Negotiating, Drawing, in or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſing of Bills, made Payable to Order.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. ITs unadviſedly done for a Drawer, if he can any way excuſe it, to make his <hi>Bills</hi> payable to order.</p>
               <p>II. And a Remitter for his own account, doth not act prudently, that orders his <hi>Bills</hi> to be made payable to the order of his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, or that doth himſelf ſo endorſe them, if the Correſpondent live at the place where the <hi>Bill</hi> is to be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>III. A Remitter that remits for another mans account, doth very imprudently, if he order the <hi>Bills</hi> to be paid to his own Order, and ſo endorſeth them; for then he himſelf ſtands obliged for the Value, without having any Advantage thereby.</p>
               <p>IV. Alſo, he that remits for another mans account, ſhould not make the <hi>Bills</hi> payable to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60840:39"/>his own order, and ſo endorſe them; for then he makes them his own <hi>Bills,</hi> and is obliged to anſwer the Rechange, and the Charges, &amp;c. but if he order the <hi>Bills</hi> to be made pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Principal, or his Order, then he is obliged for no more than the Sum he received, and may place that Rechange and Charges to the Principal's Account.</p>
               <p>V. He that remits to a third, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of another, the third Perſon dwelling where the <hi>Bill</hi> is to be diſcharged, muſt not order the <hi>Bills</hi> to be made payable to the order of him to whom he remits, unleſs the Principal hath given expreſs order ſo to do.</p>
               <p>VI. If any remit for their own account, with a deſign to redraw the ſame himſelf, or order it to be redrawn by ſome other, in ſome other place, or for ſome other account, &amp;c. then they muſt obſerve this, to order the <hi>Bills</hi> to be made payable (or ſo endorſe them) to their own order, or to the order of him that ſhall redraw them; for none can nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate or redraw a <hi>Bill of Exchange,</hi> except it be made payable to his order who muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate it, becauſe a Bill made expreſly pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any one, muſt be paid to him, and no other.</p>
               <p>VII. In the Redrawing of a <hi>Bill,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60840:39"/>is looked upon, as the abſolute and firſt Drawer, and the Remitter conſidered as the firſt Remitter; ſo that the Endorſer of a <hi>Bill</hi> is as ſtrictly obliged as the firſt Drawer and Maker of it, and the Poſſeſſor thereof hath as much Right and Law againſt him, as againſt the firſt Drawer.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Redrawer or the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a Bill, does not make a new <hi>Bill,</hi> but endorſeth the old, in ſuch like words as theſe, <hi>Pay this for me to</hi> A. A. <hi>(or to his order) the value hereof in my own hands</hi> (<hi>or from</hi> B. B. <hi>or, &amp;c.</hi>) C. C.</p>
               <p>IX. By this Endorſement, he to whom the Bill is ſent, is the true and right Poſſeſſor of it, and needs no further Aſſignation, Tranſport, or any other Title or Right, neither need he give the Drawer or the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter any further account of it, <hi>viz.</hi> how he comes by the Bill.</p>
               <p>X. And thus, when the Endorſement is made payable to order, he to whom it is endorſed as payable, may again endorſe it, and ſo may as often be endorſed as there is room on the <hi>Bill</hi> for Endorſements.</p>
               <p>XI. The Acceptant himſelf, as well as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60840:40"/>any other, may freely negotiate thoſe <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> that are by him accepted for his own account, if they be made payable to order, by the firſt Poſſeſſor or Endorſer of them; and he may again endorſe them, and negotiate them, and make them payable to his (the <hi>Acceptants</hi>) order, and yet all this time the firſt Endorſers ſhall be never the leſs obliged.</p>
               <p>XII. If the Endorſement have no more than, <hi>Pay for me to</hi> N. N. and it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt from whom the Value was received, or was reſcounted, then its look't on as no more than a ſingle order, and the Endorſer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſtill as the <hi>Principal Poſſeſſor of the Bill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. In all Endorſements, the place where, and the time when it was done, ought alſo to be expreſt; and above all, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer muſt obſerve to ſubſcribe his Name.</p>
               <p>XIV. He that Antidates an Endorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is guilty of fraud and deceit.</p>
               <p>XV. A Remitter that hath an endorſed <hi>Bill</hi> put into his hands, muſt obſerve if the Bill itſelf be well made, and be compleat in all its Requiſits, as if he himſelf were the firſt Remitter; but eſpecially, he muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, if in the Endorſement, the Name of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60840:40"/>him, to whom it muſt be paid, be well and truly writ.</p>
               <p>XVI. A Redrawer or Endorſer doth very imprudently, if he deliver into the hands of his Remitter, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, Bills that he hath by him endorſed in <hi>blanco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVII. But yet greater is the hazard and folly of the Endorſer, to ſend away Bills with a <hi>blanco</hi> Endorſement; and yet greater is the Error, when he that ſends the Bills away, and the Endorſer, are two diſtinct Perſons.</p>
               <p>XVIII. He alſo is very careleſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that ſends away a Bill of Exchange made payable to his order, with a deſign to redraw the Moneys, or to demand Payment, and doth not firſt endorſe his <hi>Bills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. If an Endorſer commit any Error in the endorſing, or hath neglected any thing, ſo that there is likely damage to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it, then the ſaid Endorſer is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to make good the Loſs, and neither the Endorſers before nor after him, are any wayes chargeable with it.</p>
               <p>XX. The Endorſer muſt bind himſelf
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60840:41"/>preciſely to the tenure of the Bill, both as to the Sum and Time of Payment.</p>
               <p>XXI. If the Endorſer cannot meet with a Remitter, for the Neat and preciſe Sum, then if he meet with two Remitters, its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved if he hath both the Bills (the <hi>Prima</hi> and <hi>Secunda</hi>) in his Hands, that he ought to Endorſe them both, on the one, ſo much to <hi>A.</hi> the value of <hi>B.</hi> and the reſt on <hi>C.</hi> the value of <hi>D.</hi> and ſo gives to <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> each one Bill; Or in caſe he find but Moneys for a part at one time, and hath time enough to keep the Bill to ſeek for more, then he endorſeth both Bills, to pay ſo much to <hi>E.</hi> the value of <hi>F.</hi> and the reſt to his order, and gives one Bill to <hi>F.</hi> and keeps the other till further conveniency. But if there be but one <hi>Bill</hi> in the Endorſers hands, and he nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates the <hi>Bill</hi> with two Perſons, then he muſt endorſe that <hi>Bill</hi> he hath, and take the Copy of it, and endorſe it alſo, ſo much payable to one, the reſt to another; and the original <hi>Bill</hi> muſt be delivered to him that hath the greater Sum, and the Copy to the other, who muſt receive the reſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> It ſtands in the pleaſure of him, to whom the Bill is directed, to accept it, or not; The Principal is not bound to accept his Factor's or Servant's Bill, unleſs he will; much leſs a Factor or Servant to accept their Principal's Bills.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60840:42"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>VI.</hi> Though the deſigned Acceptant hath by Letter adviſed of, and promiſed Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for the account of a third Perſon, yet the Poſſeſſor of the <hi>Bill</hi> cannot compel him by virtue of his Promiſe to accept, if he will not voluntarily do it: But however, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains obliged to the Drawer, to make good all the loſs and damage, either in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and Charges, or in credit of the Drawer, ſeeing he drew relying on the Faithfulneſs and Promiſe of the promiſed Acceptance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VII.</hi> To <hi>accept a Bill of Exchange,</hi> is to oblige himſelf to the Payment and Diſcharge thereof; and he that accepts muſt diſcharge it; for by Acceptance he makes himſelf Debtor; and if the <hi>Drawer</hi> ſhould chance to fail, before it be diſcharged, the <hi>Acceptant</hi> muſt notwithſtanding ſatisfie it, and can have no redreſs on the Endorſers.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60840:43"/>he will accept it or not) till he compare it with his Letter of Advice, and to give his Roſolution, and note it in his Memorial; but then, before the return of the Poſt, he demands it again, and a poſitive Anſwer; and in caſe he refuſe Acceptance, in manner and form above, he inſtantly, without delay, cauſeth it to be proteſted.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>XVII.</hi> If a Bill by negligence, or on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, is left in the hands of the Acceptant, till the day of Payment, or till evil and bad Reports are divulged of, and concerning the <hi>Drawer,</hi> and that the deſigned <hi>Acceptant</hi> hath not promiſed Acceptance; in ſuch a caſe, the deſigned <hi>Acceptant</hi> cannot be compelled to diſcharge the ſaid Bill, on pretence that he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60840:43"/>ſhould have returned the Bill, if he would not have accepted it; for it is the Duty of the <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor,</hi> to take care for his Bill, and to ſee that the ſame be either accepted or proteſted; and if the deſigned Acceptant hath not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written it, nor promiſed Acceptance, he is not obliged, nor can be compelled; but yet it had been prudence in him, preſently and without delay to have returned the Bill to the Poſſeſſor, and declared, that he would not accept it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XVIII.</hi> He that receives a Bill payable at ſight, or ſome dayes after ſight, &amp;c. and detains the ſame by him ſome dayes, without declaring whether he will accept it or no, is obliged, if he afterwards reſolve to accept it, to accept it from the day that it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XIX.</hi> In caſe a Bill payable at a Moneth after ſight, be preſented for Acceptance the laſt day of the Moneth, he may accept it that day, and it will not be payable till the laſt day of the next Moneth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XX.</hi> Though the Acceptant hath accepted the Bills drawn on him, yet the Drawer is ſtill obliged, till it be paid; but he that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts a Bill of Exchange, is obliged to the performance, ſo long till it be ſatisfied;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60840:44"/>no length of time, nor negligence in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding can weaken, or make void the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and in that reſpect, an Acceptant is more obliged than the Drawer; for if the Bill be not ſatisfied within the limitted time, and the Poſſeſſor neglects to proteſt for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance, he thereby looſeth the advantage of ſeeking his Redreſs on the Drawer, but not on the Acceptant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXI.</hi> A <hi>Remitter</hi> acts prudently, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay he demand Acceptance, ſeeing delay may breed danger, and ſuſpicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports concerning the <hi>Drawer</hi> being ſpread abroad, may cauſe the <hi>Acceptant</hi> to refuſe Acceptance of his Bills, which before he would have done, if the Acceptance had inſtantly been demanded; and if by Fraud, or ſome other Abuſe one Bill ſhould twice be drawn in, he that demands Acceptance firſt, and gets it, ſhall oblige the <hi>Acceptant</hi> to make Payment, whereas the other that hath delay'd, muſt ſeek his Redreſs on the <hi>Endorſer,</hi> and the caſe may be as it will, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once got acceptance, then the <hi>Remitter</hi> hath two obliged for the Payment, whereas otherwiſe he hath but one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXII.</hi> It tends alſo very much to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and peace of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> whether it be for his own or for ſome other account, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60840:44"/>alwayes, eſpecially when the Bill is payable at ſight, or ſome Dayes, or Weeks, or Moneths after ſight, or at uſance (when uſance is reckoned after ſight) the Acceptance be procured without delay, for otherwiſe he can make no true account when his Bills are due, and when payable; and in all caſes, the Acceptance is an Obligation and Security to the <hi>Drawer</hi> as well as to the <hi>Remitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NB, That as in moſt places it is ordered by the Magiſtrate in how many dayes after a Bill is due, it ought to be proteſted, if not paid, ſo alſo it ought to be ordered in how many dayes after the offering of the Bills the Acceptance ſhould be demanded, &amp; when to be proteſted for Non-Acceptance, and the <hi>Drawer</hi> ſhould be adviſed thereof, upon penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that by neglect or delay the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of the Bill, or the <hi>Remitter,</hi> ſhould looſe the liberty of ſeeking redreſs on the <hi>Drawer,</hi> as well as for neglect of proteſting for Non-Payment till it be too late.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXIII.</hi> Every <hi>Remitter</hi> that remits not directly, but deſigns to draw in the remitted Sum again, either by himſelf, or others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in other places, ought to ſend the <hi>prima</hi> Bill directly to the place where Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance muſt be demanded; and then, in caſe he order the accepted Bill to be left in the hands of the Perſon that demanded acceptance, he may endorſe the <hi>ſecunda</hi> Bill, but he muſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60840:45"/>not forget to adviſe in whoſe hands the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Bill remains, and of whom it muſt be demanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXIV.</hi> When the <hi>Remitter</hi> ſends his Bill away to demand acceptance, he ought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to order his Friend, whether he ſhall keep it by him, or return it to him again when accepted, or ſend it to any other Perſon; or, if he muſt keep it, whether he muſt deliver it to him that ſhall ſhew him the endorſed Bill.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>XXVII.</hi> What is once accepted can no way be diſſanulled and made void; an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant</hi> is obliged to the Payment, though he never had in his hands, nor peruſed the Bill, if it can be made appear that he in words accepted it; wherefore the <hi>Acceptant</hi> ſhould be careful, and accept no Bills but ſuch as he will pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXVIII.</hi> As the <hi>Acceptant</hi> is free to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or not accept any <hi>Bills,</hi> for whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſoever offered, ſo its free for him to accept freely, or <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt ſimply, or with any limitation or condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXIX.</hi> But a prudent <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of the Bill will accept of no conditional or limitative Acceptance, whereby either the Payment is prolonged or made difficult, or the tenure of the Bill any way altered, unleſs he have expreſs order from the <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Remitter</hi> ſo to do, but will proteſt againſt the <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> as if he had abſolutely refuſed to accept it; for whoever doth otherwiſe, and ſuffers himſelf to be ſatisfied with a conditional Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, muſt run the <hi>riſco,</hi> and hazard himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXX.</hi> If a Bill be drawn to <hi>Thomas, John</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> they not being Partners,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60840:46"/>nor one any way obliged to another, every one muſt accept for his proportion, and for as much as he will pay, and ſo none of them are obliged in <hi>ſolidum,</hi> and the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> muſt be content with ſuch an Acceptance; but in caſe they altogether accept not for the full Sum, then he may and muſt proteſt againſt them all in particular, though one or two of them have accepted for their full Proportion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXXI.</hi> An <hi>Acceptant</hi> ſhould be careful, and not accept any Bills, not having advice thereof from the <hi>Drawer,</hi> or at leaſt, not accept any ſuch but <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> though he have order from a third Perſon, that if ſuch a Sum or greater be drawn for his account, to accept of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>XXXIII.</hi> Nor ſhould he accept of any Bills ſubſcribed by any that pretend to have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60840:46"/>Order and full Power from another, unleſs he know his Seal and Hand-writing, and the <hi>Principal</hi> hath given advice that he hath given Order and full Power to ſuch and ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for ſuch and ſuch ends.</p>

                  <hi>XXXV.</hi> A Servant muſt be careful in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>Bills</hi> that his Maſter draws upon him; for if he accept in his own Name, he oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf Perſonally, as for his own Debt, and as if the <hi>Bill</hi> were for his own account, (though he do no buſineſs but his Maſters) but then the effects he hath of his Maſters in his hands are obliged for the ſame, for ſo far as they reach, and if they are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, he muſt debit his Maſter for the reſt; wherefore let a Servant when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writes <hi>Bills</hi> for his Maſters accounts (accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his Maſters account) and then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>write his own Name.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>XXXVIII. Marius</hi>'s advice is, that if a Bill be drawn on two, or more, they ought all to accept, or upon refuſal, the Bill for want of due acceptance, muſt be proteſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXXIX.</hi> But if a Bill be drawn on two
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60840:47"/>or more, and it be thus expreſt, <hi>To</hi> A. B. <hi>and</hi> C. D. <hi>or either of them,</hi> its being accepted by either of them is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of Proteſting for Non-Acceptance.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IF a Bill be preſented for Acceptance, and the <hi>Acceptant</hi> refuſe abſolutely to accept it, then the Poſſeſſor of the Bill is obliged inſtantly without delay to make Proteſt for Non-Acceptance.</p>
               <p>II. If the Acceptant cannot preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare whether he will accept or no, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth ſhortly to do it, or at the return of the next Poſt, then the Poſſeſſor of the Bill may without any Prejudice, at the requeſt of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60840:48"/>Acceptant wait ſome days, or till the next Poſt day, and need not proteſt, yet if he will not wait ſo long, he is not obliged thereto, but may if he will inſtantly proteſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the requeſt, pretences and excuſes of the Acceptant.</p>
               <p>III. As the Acceptance of a Bill may be demanded by any Perſon whatſoever that hath the Bill in his hands, ſo alſo in caſe of Non-Acceptance, any Perſon whatſoever may proteſt, though his Name be not in the Bill, nor in the Endorſments.</p>
               <p>IV. Proteſt is ordinarily made by a <hi>Notary Publick</hi> in the preſence of two credible <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> either in the preſence of the deſigned <hi>Acceptant</hi> himſelf in any place, or at his Houſe or Lodging where the <hi>Notary Publick</hi> ſhews the Bill, and demands Acceptance; and in caſe of refuſal, he proteſts for all Charges, Loſs and Intereſt, Exchange and Rechange, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>NB, At <hi>Venice</hi> all proteſts are made by the Servants of the <hi>Colledge of Commerce,</hi> and they are all particularly Regiſtered in a Book for that purpoſe, to which every Merchant hath free acceſs, which is a very commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Order, for by this means many Bills (that otherwiſe would be returned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted) are accepted <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60840:48"/>of the Drawer or Endorſer; and alſo, by this means is (many times) diſcovered the difference that the Merchants have of their Forreign Correſpondents, and in caſe of Proteſts for Non-Payment, their inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or at leaſt, the baſeneſs of the Acceptant, which tends much to their advantage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they can regulate their concerns the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſuch an Order in all places of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change would be very profitable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to Commerce, as if here in <hi>England</hi> an <hi>Office of Proteſts</hi> were erected, and that none might make Proteſts but they that are authorized thereto, and that none might make full Powers, or Letters of Attourney to any to draw, or accept Bills in the Names of others, but they or their Order, and ſhould keep Regiſters thereof, to which every one ſhould have free acceſs; here alſo ſhould all full Powers given by any be revoked, and the time of the Revocation regiſtered; and here alſo may Acceptants ſee if any Bills of theirs made payable to order, be entred to be proteſted on the laſt day of Payment, for Non-Payment, and ſo come to know where the Bill is to be found, and who is the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of it, and ſo prevent the Proteſting of it, under the pretence of the Acceptants having no order to make Payment, when the reaſon of the delay is, becauſe he knows not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> whom to pay it: Theſe alſo may be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60840:49"/>ordered, in caſe any Bills be proteſted for Non-Acceptance, that are redrawn and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed by others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to give Advice thereof to the firſt <hi>Remitter,</hi> or the firſt <hi>Drawer,</hi> whereby many Inconveniences and much Loſs may be prevented.</p>
               <p>V. If the Notary Publick meet the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant, and he abſolutely refuſe to accept, then its uſual for the Notary to demand the Reaſons thereof, which Reaſons he is obliged to inſert in the Proteſt.</p>
               <p>VI. If the deſigned Acceptant would not formally affront the <hi>Drawer,</hi> he may (and it is uſual) give ſuch Reaſons for his refuſal that tend leaſt to his diſcredit, of which the moſt uſual are, <hi>Becauſe he hath no advice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> or <hi>He himſelf will adviſe the</hi> Drawer <hi>of the Reaſons,</hi> or <hi>For want of order from the third Perſon, for whoſe account the Bill is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. Its no lawful Excuſe to refuſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance becauſe the Bill is made payable to order, and is not endorſed, or becauſe the Acceptant will know before he accept, to whom it is payable.</p>
               <p>VIII. Nor is it a lawful Excuſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, <hi>That he hath accepted the other Bill, and that he will not accept two Bills for one Sum and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60840:49"/>Parcel;</hi> for the Acceptance can be made with this condition, <hi>That the ſame ſhall be of no effect if he have accepted one of the Bills already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. A Poſſeſſor of a Bill may proteſt againſt a limitted and conditional Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as alſo againſt an Acceptance without date and Subſcription of the Name of the Acceptant, as if the Acceptance had been abſolutely refuſed.</p>
               <p>X. If an Acceptant make any Difficulties ſimply to accept the Bill, and the Poſſeſſor will accept of no conditional Acceptance, and therefore proteſts, and the Acceptant gives for Anſwer, <hi>That he is ready and willing to accept the ſame for a longer time,</hi> or <hi>For a leſs Sum,</hi> or with ſome other Conditions, he ſhould do well and prudently to add thereto, <hi>On condition the Demander of Acceptance will inſtantly and preſently declare whother he will accept of ſuch an Acceptance or not; and in caſe he be ſilent to proteſt formally, that he will not be obliged to this Acceptance for the future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. If the Notary find not the Acceptant at Home, nor can meet with him in any other place, then he doth his buſineſs effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if he demand acceptance of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant's Wife, or of Father or Mother, Siſter or Brother, Man Servant or Maid Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60840:50"/>or any other in the Houſe; and if none be at Home, if he relate the matter to any of his Neighbours, and expreſs the ſame at large in the Proteſt.</p>
               <p>XII. If the Acceptant be abroad, and hath left no Order, nor given any full Power to any to accept the Bills that are drawn on him, then the Poſſeſſor of the Bill need not wait till his return Home, but muſt Proteſt for Non-Acceptance at the Houſe of the ſaid Acceptant, or at his Lodgings.</p>
               <p>XIII. If the Acceptant is not known, nor can be found, then the Notary ought to go to the Poſt-houſe, or ſome other place where he can conveniently enquire of him; and if for all this he cannot find him, he muſt then proteſt, and inſert in the Proteſt how dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent he was to find him out.</p>
               <p>XIV. If two Perſons of one and the ſame Name live in the ſame Town, and the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor knows not which of them the Bill is directed to, if they both refuſe Acceptance, he is obliged to proteſt againſt both.</p>
               <p>XV. A Proteſt for Non-Acceptance need not neceſſarily be made at the place where the Bill is to be paid, but may be made at the place where the Acceptant lives, and in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60840:50"/>any place whatſoever where the Acceptant may be found.</p>
               <p>XVI. In every Proteſt, either above or at the end thereof, or in the middle thereof, the <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> that is proteſted, muſt be Tranſcribed and Copied, together with the Superſcription, and all the Endorſements (from word to word) if there be any, and it muſt be expreſt thus, that <hi>This is the Copy of the Original Bill that is proteſted, whereof Acceptance was demanded, but refuſed;</hi> and then what anſwer the Acceptant further gave to the Demanders of Acceptance.</p>
               <p>XVII. <hi>Marius</hi> his advice is, Preſently upon the refuſal of Acceptance to enter the Proteſt, at leaſt, there is no neceſſity of giving three dayes, or one hours reſpit to conſider on't, whether the Accepter will reſolve to accept or no.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Yet at the requeſt of a known honeſt Merchant ſome time may be given, provided the anſwer and reſolution whether he will accept or no, be given before the next Poſt (after the Receipt of the Bill) be ready to depart, that ſo the Poſſeſſor of the Bill may adviſe whether he hath proteſted or no.</p>
               <p>XIX. If the Party that accepted the Bill
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60840:51"/>dye before it be due at the appointed time of Payment, the Poſſeſſor muſt make demand of his Executors, Adminiſtrators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the laſt dwelling Houſe of the Acceptant; and if they do not preſently pay, then muſt a Proteſt be entred, as you would have done if the Acceptant had been living.</p>
               <p>XX. If the Party to whom payable ſhould dye before the Bill fall due, yet nevertheleſs the Moneys and Payment muſt be demanded at the time by one or other, and if the Party demanding in the Name of the deceaſed ſhall offer ſufficient Security to the Acceptant, and it be refuſed, Proteſt muſt be entred againſt him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IF an Acceptant ſcruple to give Acceptance, for the account of him for whoſe account the Letter of Advice ſaith it is drawn; or if for want of advice, he know not for whoſe account it is drawn, then he may, if he look
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60840:51"/>upon the Drawer as ſufficient, accept the ſaid Bill <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> and for his account.</p>
               <p>II. Though it is not uſual to make a formal Notarial Proteſt upon an Acceptance <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, for want of advice, but only clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expreſs at the Acceptance, that it is <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt accepted, yet its better, and the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant acts more prudently and ſafely, when he is not fully aſſured of the Sufficiency and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> that he cauſe the Bill to be formally proteſted, or at leaſt, that he cauſe a Notary Publick to obſerve and note, that the Acceptance is not ſimply given, but <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt.</p>
               <p>III. When a Bill is made payable to order, and endorſed by a ſufficient man before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance be demanded, then if the <hi>Acceptant</hi> ſcruple to accept for the account of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> or for the account of him for whoſe account it is drawn, he may <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it in honour of the Endorſer.</p>
               <p>IV. When the <hi>Acceptant</hi> doth thus accept <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of the Endorſer, he muſt cauſe a formal Proteſt firſt to be made for Non-Acceptance, and is obliged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay to ſend the ſaid Proteſt to the ſaid Endorſer for whoſe honour and account he hath accepted it.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:60840:52"/>
               <p>V. An acceptance <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt obligeth the Acceptant abſolutely to the Payment as much as if there had been no Proteſt, for its all one to the Poſſeſſor of the Bill, for whoſe account it be accepted, if it be accepted at all, and the Poſſeſſor hath his redreſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy as ſufficiently as ever on all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſers and Drawers, if the Payment be not punctually made at the day by the Acceptant.</p>
               <p>VI. A Poſſeſſor of a Bill muſt be ſatisfied and contented with an acceptance <hi>ſupra</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt (for it concerns not him in the leaſt whether the Acceptant give a ſimple accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or an acceptance <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, ſeeing the Acceptant muſt pay the Charges to the Notary Publick) except he had order from the Remitter, not to accept of ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; and then in caſe of refuſal of a ſimple Acceptance, he muſt and may proteſt.</p>
               <p>VII. When an Acceptant hath accepted a Bill <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, and the Poſſeſſor of the Bill is not ſatisfied with it, and by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Publick and Witneſſes, demands a ſimple Acceptance, or upon refuſal makes a Proteſt, then the Acceptant (if he be reſolved not to accept ſimply and freely) doth act prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wiſely if he renounce his Acceptance <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, deſiring that it may be inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60840:52"/>in the Proteſt, and be conſidered as void and of no offect, as if it had never been done.</p>
               <p>VIII. No man, neither the Poſſeſſor nor the Demander of Acceptance, nor any third Perſon whatever, may accept a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change unleſs the Acceptant refuſe, or is not to be found, or hath left no order for the Acceptance.</p>
               <p>IX. When the Acceptant will not accept at all, then the Poſſeſſor himſelf may, after he hath proteſted for Non-Acceptance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſame <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt.</p>
               <p>X. This alſo may a third Perſon (that is not concerned in the Bill) do, whether the honour of the ſame Bill be recommended to him or not, and that neither in honour of the Drawer or any Endorſer, or of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for whoſe account it is drawn, <hi>i. e.</hi> he may accept <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt.</p>
               <p>XI. An Acceptance <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt muſt be done in this manner; the Acceptant <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, whoever he be, muſt perſonally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before a Notary Publick and Witneſſes, (whether it be the ſame Notary that made the Proteſt or not, matters not) and there he muſt declare that he doth accept ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60840:53"/>Bill in honour of the Drawer or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer, &amp;c. and that he will ſatisfie the ſame at the appointed time; and then he muſt write under the Bill with his own hand, <hi>That he hath accepted it</hi> ſupra <hi>Proteſt in honour of ſuch and ſuch, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. An Acceptance <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt may be made ſo, that though it be in honour of the <hi>Drawer,</hi> yet it may alſo oblige the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſers,</hi> and in ſuch a caſe the Proteſt muſt be ſent to the Endorſer; but theſe too cautious Practices of ſome tend more to the diſcredit of the Drawer than to his honour.</p>
               <p>XIII. A Poſſeſſor of a Bill is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to accept of the Acceptance of a third Perſon <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, whoſe ſufficiency he ſuſpects, ſeeing the <hi>Drawer</hi> is obliged to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the <hi>Remitter</hi> in caſe of Non-acceptance; but if the third Perſon will offer ſufficient ſecurity for the Payment of the Bill, then the Poſſeſſor muſt be ſatisfied and contented therewith.</p>
               <p>XIV. A Poſſeſſor of a Bill is not obliged to accept of the Acceptance of a third Perſon <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of any of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſers, or of the Drawer, if the Acceptant <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt will re-draw the ſame on the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60840:53"/>Endorſer or Drawer, except he declare,<note place="margin">NB</note> that the honour of the Bill was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him by the Endorſer or Drawer, or that he declare, that he hath Effects in his hands for the account of the Endorſer or Drawer, whereby he can ſatisfie the Bill without redrawing on either the Endorſer or Drawer.</p>
               <p>XV. When the Poſſeſſor of a Bill hath accepted of the Acceptance of a third <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> in honour of the Drawer, then the Drawer is not in any wiſe obliged to give any further ſatisfaction to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter. But if the Acceptance be made in honour of an Endorſer, then the Bill in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Drawer is as abſolutely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, and he is oblieged to give Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either to the Endorſer, in whoſe honour it was accepted, or to the Remitter, as if the Acceptance <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> had never been made.</p>
               <p>XVI. When a Bill is for Non-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance Proteſted, and after <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> by a third Perſon accepted, &amp;c. and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Acceptant afterwards gets further Advice and Order, and reſolves abſolutely to accept and pay the ſame, then the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> may ſuffer it, and yet the Poſſeſſor ſhall not be oblieged, to free
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60840:54"/>and acquit him from his Acceptance; but the firſt deſigned Acceptant is obliged to pay the Acceptant <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> Proviſion and Charges, &amp;c. becauſe by his acceptance <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> he hindred the Bill from being returned with Proteſt.</p>
               <p>XVII. Any Man that will may <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> accept a Proteſted Bill in honour of the Drawer, or any particular Endorſer, that was before accepted <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> in honour of ſome particular, but later En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer, and the firſt Acceptant is obliged to allow of the ſame, and yet remain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged for his firſt acceptance, but the laſt Acceptant is obliged to pay and allow Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and Charges to the firſt, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon above: For inſtance, if there were three Endorſers, and one man accepts the Bill <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> in honour of the laſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother may come and accept again in honour of the firſt or ſecond Endorſer.</p>
               <p>XVIII. He whoever he be, that accepts a Bill <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> puts himſelf abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſtead of the firſt deſigned Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and is obliged to make the Payment without any exception, and the Poſſeſſor hath the ſame Right and Law againſt ſuch a one, as he would have had againſt the firſt deſigned Acceptant, if he had accepted.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60840:54"/>
               <p>XIX. He that accepts a Bill <hi>ſupra Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi> may lawfully demand a Recompence for the credit given to him, in whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he accepted, as well as Proviſion and Poſtidge, and other charges; and in caſe the Acceptant ſhould be forced to Re-draw the parcel on him for whoſe honour he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he ought truly and faithfully without contradiction to accept and honour his ſaid Acceptants Bills, and return him Thanks for his Service.</p>
               <p>XX. No Man ought to accept a Bill <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> in honour of the Drawer, unleſs he hath firſt ſpoken with the deſigned Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and known the Reaſons why he ſuffers it to be proteſted; but if the Acceptance be in honour of an Endorſer, this Information is to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>XXI. When a Bill is proteſted for Non-Acceptance, though the <hi>Drawer</hi> and his Hand-writing be never ſo well known, if the Perſon for whoſe account it was drawn be unknown, and cannot be found, then no man ought to be too free and liberal in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the ſame <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of the <hi>Drawer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXII. He that accepts a Bill <hi>ſupra</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60840:55"/>in honour of any Endorſer, or of the Drawer, though it be without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or order, yet he hath his Redreſs and Remedy on the ſaid Perſon for whoſe honour he accepted (who is obliged to indemniſie him) as if he had full Orders ſo to do.</p>
               <p>XXIII. If a Drawer or Endorſer, in whoſe honour a Bill is accepted <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, return an Anſwer to the Acceptant <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, and approves of the ſaid Acceptance, then the Acceptant may freely pay the Bill, without any further Proteſt for Non-Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but if the Perſons in whoſe honour the Bill was accepted are Quarrelſom, and pretend they gave no ſuch order to him, or if they anſwer not at all, then let the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt cauſe a formal Proteſt for Non-Payment to be drawn up againſt the firſt deſigned Acceptant; and if then the Notary return without Payment, and the Acceptant <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt be forced to pay the Bill, then he muſt order the Action, Right and Law of the Bill to be ended and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported fully to him, as if he were the true Poſſeſſor thereof, that ſo he may have his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs on the Drawer or Endorſer, in whoſe honour he accepted, or on any of the former Endorſers.</p>
               <p>XXIV. He that accepts a Bill in honour of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60840:55"/>the Drawer, hath no remedy againſt any of the Endorſers, becauſe he only obligeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Drawer.</p>
               <p>XXV. He that accepts in honour of an Endorſer, hath no advantage of any Endor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers that followed him for whoſe honour he accepted; but he and all that were before him, even to the Principal and firſt Drawer are all obliged to him, to make him ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>XXVI. When an Acceptant gets advice that a certain Sum is drawn upon him, and two firſt or two ſecond Bills of one and the ſame Contents, Date and Sum, but endorſed to be paid to ſeveral, be preſented, then let him accept neither of them, neither freely nor <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt; and if the one be accepted before the other be preſented, let him proteſt the latter, and not accept it <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of the Drawer, unleſs he hath Letters of Advice of each particular Bill from the Drawer.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> What the Poſſeſſor of a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change proteſted for Non-Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and is not accepted <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, together with the Drawer and Endorſer, are obliged to.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. HE that hath proteſted a Bill for Non-Acceptance, whether he be the true and real Owner of the ſame, or only a third Perſon, to whom it is ſent to procure Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, muſt (if it be not accepted <hi>ſupra</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt) adviſe the Perſon by whom it was given or ſent to him, for procuring Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the very firſt opportunity, and ſend or give to the ſame Perſon either the Proteſt alone, or both the Bill and the Proteſt.</p>
               <p>II. If a Bill be made payable poſitively to ſuch a Perſon, and Acceptance is abſolutely denyed, then both the Bill and the Proteſt muſt be returned whence they came; but if Acceptance be delay'd, and not abſolutely
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60840:56"/>denyed, but hopes are given by the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant that he will accept it the next Poſt, or very ſhortly, he expecting more ſufficient Orders and further Advice, and that then he may accept the proteſted Bill; then he that hath the Bill in Poſſeſſion muſt only return the Proteſt, and keep the Bill.</p>
               <p>III. He that hath a Bill proteſted for Non-Acceptance, which is not payable to himſelf, nor endorſed to him, but is payable to the order of the Remitter, or the Drawer, &amp;c. muſt only return the Proteſt, and muſt keep the Bill in his Poſſeſſion till it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him by him to whom it is payable, and on whom it is endorſed.</p>
               <p>IV. If the Proteſt be not made in the preſence of the Acceptant himſelf, he being abſent, from home, or not to be found, then ought only the Proteſt to be returned, and the Bill muſt be detained till the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or till further order, that if the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant be found, he may demand accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of him, and he may accept if he pleaſe; and in caſe of refuſal, its beſt and prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for the Poſſeſſor, or the Perſon that ſhould demand acceptance, to make another formal Proteſt againſt the ſaid Acceptant.</p>
               <p>V. When a Bill made payable to order,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60840:57"/>that is not ſent to the Preſenter by the firſt Remitter, but by ſome other, is proteſted for non-acceptance, then the Preſenter doth act prudently, if the Bill be endorſed and drawn in from other places, if he not only ſend the Proteſt to the Perſon from whom he received the Bill, but alſo give Advice directly to the firſt Remitter of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance, and that it is therefore Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB,</hi> It would be very convenient and neceſſary, that it ſhould be ordered, that all Proteſts, either for Non-acceptance or Non-payment, as alſo in caſe of the ſailure of the Acceptant and his Inſolency, when the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter cannot ſend the principal Act and Proteſt to the firſt Remitter, that then the Notaries ſhould be obliged to ſend a Copy of the ſaid Proteſt inſtantly and directly to the firſt <hi>Remitter,</hi> which might eaſily be done if ſome few <hi>Notaries</hi> were appointed to that Office, as is before obſerved in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. and <hi>Rule</hi> 4. this would prevent much Damage and Loſs.</p>
               <p>VI. The <hi>Remitter</hi> is obliged ſo ſoon as he receives advice of the Proteſt of the Bill to give advice thereof to the Drawer.</p>
               <p>VII. A Drawer or Endorſer of a Bill is obliged not upon a ſimple advice, but ſo ſoon
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60840:57"/>as the Proteſt is ſhewn to him, either with or without the Bill, to give ſufficient ſecurity for the Payment thereof at the time and place appointed, or elſe for the Principal and Charges and Rechange, in caſe it be not ſatisfied there.</p>
               <p>VIII. When the Bill hath yet ſo much time remaining before the day of Payment come that the Drawer or Endorſer can order the Payment thereof at the place appointed at the day of Payment, then is the Remitter obliged, having got ſecurity to return the Bill, together with the Proteſt, to the place where Payment is to be made, there to demand Payment of the Acceptant, or to whom it was addreſſed and directed, and if he procure Payment, he muſt demand of the Acceptant no more than the Charges of the Proteſt and Poſtidge; but if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them not, he muſt again proteſt for Non-Payment, and then the Drawer is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſatisfie the Rechange and Charges.</p>
               <p>IX. When a Bill drawn at long time, is proteſted for Non-Acceptance, and the Drawer hath given the Remitter ſufficient Security, then the Drawer is not obliged to cauſe his Bill to be accepted by the Acceptant or any other; for the Security for Acceptance is looked upon as if it were accepted.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:60840:58"/>
               <p>X. The Drawer or Endorſer give ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſecurity if they give to the Remitter other Bills payable to his order, for the ſame Sum, and due at the ſame time, that were drawn or endorſed by any Merchant that frequents the Exchange, and is by all men accounted ſufficient.</p>
               <p>XI. The Remitter is not obliged to take ſuch Bills, unleſs the Drawer promiſe to pay the Charges and Poſtidge of the Proteſt, and if not all, yet at leaſt half Proviſion for this new trouble of the Correſpondent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Acceptance; but if the Drawer appoint any other at the time and place of Payment to ſatisfie his Bill <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, and in the interim give ſufficient ſecurity, then he need allow no Proviſion at all, but only the Charges of the Proteſt and Poſtidge.</p>
               <p>XII. The Drawer or Endorſer of a Bill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted for Non-Acceptance, muſt be very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, and muſt not give to the Remitter or Preſenter of the Bill any other Bills with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the re-delivery of the firſt Bill and the Proteſt, or that the Remitter give ſufficient ſecurity for the Reſtitution thereof, or of the Value, in caſe the ſaid Bill ſhould be ſatisfied.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:60840:58"/>
               <p>XIII. The Remitter is not obliged, nor indeed is it adviſable for him to enter into ſuch an Obligation, becauſe the Drawer is obliged to procure Acceptance and Payment of his Bills by the Acceptant, or by ſome other, and theſe other Bills are but the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Remitter, which may alſo contain ſuch a clauſe and condition, that the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof ſhall only be made for the value of the Bills proteſted for Non-Acceptance, and were not <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt accepted.</p>
               <p>XIV. When the Bill with the Proteſt is preſented to the Drawer, and theſe two can agree for the Rechange, then he may freely and ſafely diſſanul the Contract with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, and ſatisfie him upon the Delivery of the firſt Bills with the Proteſt.</p>
               <p>XV. When a Bill is returned with Proteſt for Non-Acceptance, though there be yet ſufficient time for the ordering of the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the tenure of the Bills, yet if the Drawer and Remitter agree to make the Bills and Contracts void, then the Rechange ſhould be equally adjuſted, and that thus it ſhould be reckoned at the Courſe that the beſt Bills on the Exchange were negotiated at, payable at the ſame time; and over and above this, the Remitter muſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60840:59"/>demand half Proviſion at leaſt, and Courta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, together with the Charges of the Proteſt and Poſtidge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB,</hi> It were neceſſary, to prevent Diſputes and Contentions, that a certain Rule and Method were ordered for the regulating the Courſe of Re-changes, when there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it.</p>
               <p>XVI. When the <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Remitter</hi> cannot agree about the Courſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and the Drawer or Endorſer will not give any ſecurity for the ſame, but pay it in Moneys inſtantly, then it is ſufficient for the <hi>Drawer</hi> to return to the <hi>Remitter</hi> the value of the Bill that he received, and need not pay the Rechange till the day of Payment come, and they get advice in what courſe at ſight the Bills were made that Poſt or the next, and accordingly the <hi>Drawer</hi> is obliged to pay the <hi>Remitter</hi> how high or low ſoever it be, and the <hi>Remitter</hi> is obliged to be ſatisfied with it; but then in caſe the <hi>Remitter</hi> will neither at firſt (at the Payment of the value to him) nor at laſt (at the Payment of the Re-change) part with the Bills and Proteſt, the <hi>Drawer</hi> may ſo long detain his Moneys, till he give ſecurity for the Reſtitution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>XVII. If all the Bills be not to be had,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60840:59"/>the Drawer muſt be very circumſpect in his making the contract void, &amp; muſt not pay any Moneys but upon ſufficient Caution for the Re-delivery of the Bills and Proteſt, and for all the Damage and Loſs that may accrew thereby.</p>
               <p>XVIII. When the time of Payment is ſo near that the Drawer or Endorſer cannot give other orders for the Payment of the Bills at the time and place appointed, then the Poſſeſſor or Remitter of the Bill are obliged upon ſufficient caution and ſecurity offered to them for the Re-change and Charges, &amp;c. to wait till the day of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and till the Courſe be known from the place where the Payment ſhould firſt have been made.</p>
               <p>XIX. Though an Endorſer hath ſatisfied his Remitter for the Re-change and Charges of a Non-accepted proteſted Bill, yet the Drawer or an earlier Endorſer is not obliged to do the ſame, but may inſiſt upon giving ſecurity in manner and form as is above mentioned.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the time of Payment of Exchanges.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IT is ordinary and uſual in any place to make Bills of Exchange payable at a longer or ſhorer time, as the Parties can agree, no certain and fixed time being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
               <p>II. But the Time muſt preciſely be agreed upon, and written in every Bill of Exchange, that the Drawer may certainly know when they fall due; and it were therefore to be wiſht that no Bills might be made payable after ſight or at ſight, and that a certain time might be limitted, in which the Acceptance is to be demanded, upon a penalty that the Preſenter of the Bill, in caſe of the refuſal of Acceptance, might have no Redreſs upon the Drawer.</p>
               <p>III. The time of Payment is conditioned and agreed on betwixt the Drawer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, ſometimes <hi>(1ſt,)</hi> on a certain ſixed and appointed day, <hi>(2dly,)</hi> at ſight or after
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60840:60"/>ſight, <hi>(3dly,)</hi> at ſome Dayes, or Weeks, or Moneths after the date, <hi>(4thly,)</hi> at Uſance, half Uſance, Uſance and half, double and trebble Uſance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. A Bill made payable at a certain day is underſtood to be payable on that ſame day when it comes, that it falls due on, according to the Stile of the place where the Payment is to be made; ſo that a Bill made at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> payable at <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Hambrough</hi> the laſt of <hi>November,</hi> is not payable till the laſt of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> according to the <hi>Old Stile,</hi> which is the account of time that they obſerve in thoſe places; and on the contrary, a Bill made at <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Hambrough</hi> payable at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> the laſt of <hi>November,</hi> is payable at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> the laſt of <hi>November,</hi> according to the <hi>New Stile,</hi> which is the account of time that they obſerve there.</p>
               <p>V. When a Bill ſays ſimply <hi>[Pay]</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of any time, then its to be underſtood that the time of preſenting the Bill is the time of Payment, and that the Payment muſt be made at ſight.</p>
               <p>VI. If Bills be made payable at ſome days, &amp;c. after ſight, or after date, then for reckoning the time of Payment, the firſt day after the ſight, or after the date, is reckoned
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60840:61"/>the firſt day, and not the day whereon it was preſented, with which <hi>Marius</hi> alſo agrees.</p>
               <p>VII. To reckon out the preciſe time of the Payment of any Bill payable at any time after date, its neceſſary to know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Stile,</hi> if the places from whence is drawn, and on which is drawn obſerve a different Stile.

               </p>
               <p>VIII. If a Bill be made payable at ſome Weeks after ſight or date, then the Weeks muſt firſt be reduced into Dayes, and ſeven Dayes reckoned for a Week, and in account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the days of the <hi>Almanack</hi> muſt be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, taking the firſt day after the ſight or date for the firſt day, and ſo forward one day after another, without excluding either <hi>Sundayes</hi> or <hi>Holy-dayes,</hi> and the laſt day is the day of Payment, whether in the beginning or the middle of the Week.</p>
               <p>IX. If a Bill be made payable a Moneth or two after date, or after ſight, then the day of Payment falls on the ſame day of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Moneth, &amp;c. that the Bill was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

As for <hi>Example:</hi> A Bill is dated the 7th of <hi>January,</hi> and is payable a Moneth after date, this Bill is payable the 7th of <hi>February</hi> (not the 8th) A Bill dated the 30th of <hi>January,</hi> payable a Moneth after date, this Bill is payable on the 28th or 29th of <hi>February,</hi> being the laſt day of the Moneth; and ſo in Bills payable a Moneth or two after ſight, if preſented on the 30th of <hi>January,</hi> are payable on the laſt of <hi>February,</hi> though <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> hath not ſo many dayes in it.</p>

A Bill dated according to the <hi>Old Stile,</hi> payable a Moneth after date in a place where the <hi>New Stile</hi> is obſerved, does not alwayes fall due a Moneth after the date <hi>Old Stile,</hi> but a Moneth after the date according as there the <hi>New Stile</hi> was writ at the date of the Bill, and <hi>contra.</hi> For <hi>Example;</hi> A Bill dated the the 25th of <hi>April</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> according to the <hi>Old Stile,</hi> payable a Moneth after date in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> where the <hi>New Stile</hi> is writ, does not fall due at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> the 25th of <hi>May</hi> according to the <hi>Old Stile,</hi> which is the 4th of <hi>June</hi> according to the <hi>New Stile,</hi> but on the 5th of <hi>June;</hi> for when the Bill was dated the 25th of <hi>April Old Stile,</hi> it was the 5th of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60840:62"/>
                  <hi>May New Stile,</hi> and from that time muſt the Moneth be reckoned, &amp;c. and <hi>contra,</hi> this muſt be well obſerved, ſeeing in the Leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years this makes two dayes difference, in other years three dayes.</p>
               <p>XI. In the calculating the time of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Bills payable at Uſance, ſometimes Uſance is taken for ſome certain time after the date of the Bill, ſometimes for ſome certain time after ſight, nor is this in all places alike, wherefore it muſt be obſerved that,</p>
               <p>Uſance from <hi>Venice, Geneva, Liborno,</hi> all <hi>Italy, Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> is two Moneths after the date.</p>
               <p>Uſance from <hi>Paris,</hi> and all <hi>France, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and all <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and all <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> from <hi>Middleburge, Rotterdam,</hi> &amp;c. is one Moneth after date, double Uſance two Moneths, half Uſance fifteen dayes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Moneth hath but twenty eight dayes in it, or thirty one dayes.</p>
               <p>Uſance from <hi>Dantzicke</hi> and <hi>Konigsburge</hi> is one Moneth after ſight, and double Uſance two Moneths, and half Uſance fifteen days, i. e. at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> But now Exchanges from <hi>Dantzicke</hi> and <hi>Konigsburge</hi> are ſeldom made at Uſance, but ordinarily from <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zicke</hi> at forty dayes date, or after date, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60840:63"/>from <hi>Konigsburge</hi> at forty one dayes after date, i. e. at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> payable.</p>
               <p>Uſance from <hi>Neurenburge, Ausburge, Wien, Franckford,</hi> and other places in <hi>Germany,</hi> is at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> fourteen dayes after ſight, half Uſance ſeven dayes, double Uſance twenty eight dayes, which is four Weeks, and not an Almanack Moneth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the Contrary.</hi> Uſance from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Italy, Spain, Portugal,</hi> is two Moneths after date, to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Flanders, Brabant,</hi> &amp;c. one Moneth, to <hi>Paris,</hi> according to the new Royal Order, thirty dayes after date, to <hi>Ausburge,</hi> &amp;c. fourteen dayes, to <hi>Breſlaw</hi> fourteen dayes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Uſance at <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Amſterdam, Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Antwerp,</hi> one Moneth, from <hi>Venice</hi> three Moneths; From <hi>Hambrough</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Hambrough</hi> two Moneths after date, i. e. double Uſance, but Bills are commonly given at double Uſance.</p>
               <p>XII. A Bill dated the 28th of <hi>February,</hi> payable a Moneth after date, or at Uſance (and Uſance is reckoned there for a Moneth after ſight) and is preſented for acceptance the 28th of <hi>February,</hi> then it falls due the 28th of <hi>March;</hi> but if it be dated <hi>ultimo Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> then its not due till the <hi>ultimo March,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:60840:63"/>and ſo in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> the one having thirty dayes, the other thirty one, and this the Acceptant may alter if he pleaſe, if for the 30th of <hi>June</hi> he write <hi>ultimo,</hi> it will not be due till <hi>ultimo July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. In exchanging, the circumſpect Remitter will have a regard to the Time, and accordingly take his meaſures, and keep his Moneys till ſuch a time as he knows there will be great occaſion for it at the Place where he is, or remit it to ſuch a place to be remitted again, ſo alſo the Drawer muſt obſerve to take ſuch an opportunity to draw in his Moneys, when he knows there is Moneys enough ſtirring; for multitude of Bills and ſcarcity of Moneys advances the Courſe and paucity of Bills; and multitude of Moneys depreſſeth the Courſe of the Exchange in any place.</p>
               <p>XIV. An Exchanger ſhould know in the places where Banks are kept, the ordinary times when the Banks are ſhut, for the making of new Books, and when they will again be opened; for at ſuch a time there may be ſome Advantage for the Drawer and Remitter.</p>
               <p>XV. When there is Difference ariſing betwixt the Poſſeſſor or Preſenter of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60840:64"/>Bill about Calculating the Time of its pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, i. e. the preciſe Day, the Poſſeſſor or Preſenter, if circumſpect, will demand Payment on the Day according to his own Calculation, and if on the laſt day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpit he procure not Payment, he ſhould and may Proteſt, and ſend the ſame away, but he muſt detain the Bill till the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the Calculation of the Acceptant; and then if he procure not Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he muſt <hi>de Novo</hi> Proteſt.</p>
               <p>XVI. Bills made payable at two or three dayes ſight, or at ſight ſhould not have the priviledge of the reſpit dayes, (eſpecially if they be five or ſix, or more) but ſhould be paid within twenty four Hours, after the day they fall due, or be proteſted, becauſe the reaſon why Bills are made payable at ſuch ſhort ſight, is becauſe the <hi>Remitter</hi> hath preſent occaſion for his Moneys.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. THe <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of a <hi>Bill</hi> muſt be careful that the ſame be ſent to the place where payment muſt be made timouſly enough, that payment at the day of payment may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and leſt the <hi>Poſt</hi> ſhould be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or be detained any way, he muſt never keep a <hi>Bill</hi> till the laſt Moment, leſt before its arrival the day of payment be paſt, and reſpit dayes expired; for if not demanded in time, a Proteſt is afterwards inſignificant as to recover any thing of the Drawer.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of a <hi>Bill</hi> is obliged, at the day of its becoming due, to demand the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and muſt not give or admit of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays more than the reſpit dayes.</p>
               <p>III. He that takes a <hi>Bill</hi> from another to demand ſatisfaction, whether he be a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, Chaſhier, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and neglects to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it at the day of payment, and is not urgent for the ſame within the days of reſpit,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60840:65"/>but lets them paſs without proteſting, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to make good the Damage that may accrue thereby.</p>
               <p>IV. He that hath a <hi>Bill</hi> in poſſeſſion, which ſays only <hi>[Pay]</hi> without mentioning the time when, or that is not dated, or that is not clearly and legibly enough written, payable ſome time after date, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the certain preciſe time of payment cannot be calculated, muſt be very circumſpect, and demand the Moneys at any time when he can probably make it appear, or ſeem to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come due.</p>
               <p>V. He that hath a <hi>Bill</hi> ſent him to demand Acceptance, and to keep the ſame by him till it be demanded by him who ſhall produce the endorſed <hi>Bill,</hi> if the ſame endorſed <hi>Bill</hi> is not produced at the laſt day of the reſpit, nor demanded of him, then he may demand of the Acceptant payment thereof, offering caution and ſecurity for the producing the endorſed <hi>Bill,</hi> and in caſe of refuſal he may proteſt for Non-payment, and ſuch a Proteſt is of validity againſt the Drawer; but yet if he that hath the <hi>Bill</hi> hath neglected to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and to proteſt, he is not blameable for ſo doing, nor any way reſponſible, but the Detainer of the endorſed <hi>Bill</hi> may thank himſelf for his careleſneſs.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60840:65"/>
               <p>VI. If a Bill be not endorſed, or the Endorſement not right made, or if there want any thing in it, yet notwithſtanding the Poſſeſſor of the Bill is allowed to demand payment, and the Acceptant is obliged to pay him upon the Delivery of both the Bills, if he will under his Hand and Seal oblige himſelf to procure a third Bill for the ſame Sum rightly and truly endorſed.</p>
               <p>VII. Becauſe many times an Acceptant knows not to whom his Bills are payable, when they are made payable to order, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Poſſeſſor of the Bill is obliged to give the Acceptant timely notice; and its the Cuſtom at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> among Merchants that are of Repute and Credit, and that truſt one another, that the Poſſeſſor of a <hi>Bill</hi> made payable to order, and to be paid in <hi>Bank,</hi> at the day of payment to ſend the accepted and endorſed <hi>Bill</hi> to the Houſe of the Acceptant, and deſire him to order that the Value be write of in <hi>Bank;</hi> but according to a ſpecial Order of the City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> no Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of endorſed Bills are obliged to give them out of their hands, unleſs they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſatisfied; and the <hi>Poſſeſſors</hi> muſt on the day of payment declare to the <hi>Acceptants</hi> that they are to have the payment by virtue of the Endorſements, and in caſe of refuſal
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60840:66"/>to pay then before the delivery of the <hi>Bills,</hi> then the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> muſt bring the <hi>Bill</hi> to one of the <hi>Book-keepers</hi> in the <hi>Bank,</hi> there to be Regiſtered, whence the <hi>Acceptant</hi> muſt fetch them, after he hath ordered the Parcel to be writ of to the <hi>Poſſeſſors</hi> account, and not before, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>VIII. A <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of <hi>Bill</hi> payable in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Moneys, either to himſelf directly, or to order, is not obliged to part with his <hi>Bill</hi> before he be effectually ſatisfied; and if he ſuſpect the <hi>Acceptant,</hi> he muſt not exchange his <hi>Bill</hi> for an Aſſignation, whether on a Caſhier or ſome elſe, and may with good reaſon detain the <hi>Bill,</hi> till the Aſſignation be ſatisfied, in caſe he will write on the <hi>Bill</hi> that he hath received from the <hi>Acceptant</hi> an Aſſignation for ſuch a Sum, on ſuch and ſuch a Perſon.</p>
               <p>IX. In the demanding of <hi>Payment,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as well as in the whole Trade of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, Equity, Credit and Honeſty muſt be obſerved and encouraged: But Cheats and Knaves ſhould be ſeverely puniſh't, ſuch as <hi>J.

               <p>
                  <hi>II.</hi> The payment of a <hi>Bill</hi> muſt be made to the true and lawful <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Acceptants</hi> in the payment of their <hi>Bills</hi> muſt be careful and circumſpect, leſt paying it to others they be forced to pay twice.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60840:67"/>hath no Acquaintance, then its moſt adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Acceptant to delay and defer the <hi>Payment</hi> till the laſt day, if peradventure ſome other in the mean time may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV.</hi> No <hi>Bill</hi> muſt be paid before it become due; if it be paid before, the <hi>Acceptant</hi> runs the hazard and danger that may enſue; Yet this doth not hinder, but that if a <hi>Bill</hi> be made payable to order, it may be Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Endorſed; but however the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant</hi> muſt not pay before the ſame become due.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of Proteſting of Bills for Non-Payment.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. THough the Acceptant be abſolutely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the payment of thoſe Bills that he accepts; yet at the day of payment, the Payment cannot be demaned or exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Rigor, if the Drawer or Endorſers be ſufficient, and his Credit untainted: but the Poſſeſſor muſt firſt try if he can procure the Value, the Charges and the Re-change from the firſt Drawer or Endorſer peaceably and quietly.</p>
               <p>II. The Poſſeſſor hath no redreſs on the Drawer or Endorſer, unleſs he can make it appear that he made diligent Demands of payment before the Reſpit dayes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and could procure none, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did proteſt for Re-change and Charges within the limitted time.</p>
               <p>III. In all (or moſt) Towns of Trade, its ordered as a Law, in how many dayes after the <hi>Bill</hi> become due, the Proteſt muſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60840:73"/>be entred and made, in caſe the Poſſeſſor will not forfeit his Right againſt the Drawer or Endorſer.</p>
               <p>IV. Before any man can proteſt for Non-payment, demand of payment in the limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time muſt be made, and that firſt ſimply by the Poſſeſſor himſelf or his Servant, or ſome other in his Name, and then if pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do not punctually follow upon theſe Demands, he muſt ſolemnly demand it by the Notary Publick and two Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>V. This formal and ſolemn demanding of payment muſt at fartheſt be on the laſt of the Reſpit dayes, and that ſo timouſly (if it muſt be done in <hi>Bank</hi>) that the Acceptant may have ſufficient time to order it.</p>
               <p>VI. When the laſt Reſpit day falls on a <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Holy-day,</hi> then its ſafeſt to proteſt the day before.</p>
               <p>VII. Payment of <hi>Bills</hi> that were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted neither ſimply nor <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, may be demanded at the day of payment, and if payment be denyed, then a new Proteſt may immediately be entred for Non-payment, and both the <hi>Bill</hi> and <hi>Proteſt</hi> may be returned.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60840:73"/>
               <p>VIII. When a Bill that is made payable after date, or at a certain day, is not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for acceptance till after the ſame become due; then if payment be denyed, the Proteſt for Non-payment muſt be made on the laſt Reſpit day at fartheſt (after it became due) and not after it was firſt preſented.</p>
               <p>IX. A punctual Payer will diſcharge his Bills on the ſecond or third day after they are become due, and they are but Botchers that defer till the laſt reſpit day, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that the laſt Reſpit day is the true day of Payment; whereas theſe Reſpit dayes are allowed the Acceptant not for Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, but for Conveniency as well of the Poſſeſſor as the Acceptant himſelf, that the one may demand in time, and the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide in time to diſcharge his Bills; yet the Acceptant may if he will defer and delay it till the laſt day.</p>
               <p>X. If the Poſſeſſor of a Bill proteſt not till after the laſt reſpit day, he loſeth his Right of having Redreſs on the Drawer or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer by his negligence, except in the caſe of the ſhutting the <hi>Bank.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB,</hi> The caſe ſeems to be very hard when the Bill by any Miſcarriage of the Poſt, or other Impediment is detained ſo long (or it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60840:74"/>may be wholly loſt) till the reſpit dayes are expired, and then the deſigned Acceptant refuſeth either to accept or pay: and what is then to be done? its hard that the Remitter ſhould loſe his Moneys, and loſe it he muſt, if the Drawer or Acceptant be Knaviſh; for he can in no wiſe lay any Action againſt either of them, and yet it is manifeſt there is a Debt owing to him; this then being too great an Encouragement for Knaves, it were to be wiſht, that ſome other good order for preventing loſs to Honeſt and Well-meaning Perſons were invented, and enacted as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealable Law.</p>
               <p>XI. The Poſſeſſor of an endorſed Bill for the account of the Drawer himſelf, is obliged to proteſt within the Reſpit dayes, or he looſeth his Remedy of the Endorſers.</p>
               <p>XII. In the Proteſt for Non-payment, the day and date when the Proteſt was made muſt be legally expreſt, and it ought alſo to expreſs, how many dayes after it became due it was before the Proteſt was entred, and alſo what the cuſtom of the place is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Reſpit dayes, that it may appear on the one hand, how civil the Poſſeſſor hath been to the Acceptant, and on the other, how that he hath not by his negligence loſt his Right.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60840:74"/>
               <p>XIII. When a Bill is proteſted againſt the Perſon of the Acceptant, the Notary Publick ought to know him well, and make himſelf acquainted with him; and if it be made againſt his Houſe, he ought to inform himſelf well, whether ſuch a Perſon live there or not, and if he can neither find his Perſon nor his Houſe, nor enquire where he may be found, then he muſt proteſt with what diligence and care he enquired after him, and then proteſt for the Rechange, Charges and Damage to be re-paid him by the Endorſers or Drawers, or either of them, as the Poſſeſſor thinks beſt.</p>
               <p>XIV. If the Notary meet with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or any of his Houſe, he muſt clearly expreſs what Anſwer they make to him, and what the Reaſons are that he can procure no ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>XV. When payment is demanded of one of the ſame Name with him to whom the Bill is directed, and he denyes that ever he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted any ſuch <hi>Bill,</hi> then the Poſſeſſor is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to enquire if any other of the ſame Name dwell in the place where the payment ſhould be made, and if he can find none, then he muſt proteſt againſt him, and if he find two or more, and they all deny that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60840:75"/>any ſuch Bill, they muſt both or all be proteſted againſt.</p>
               <p>XVI. Its no diſpect or diſcredit to any to ſuffer a <hi>Bill</hi> to be proteſted for Non-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance becauſe it ſtands in his own free will to accept or not; but to ſuffer an accepted Bill to be proteſted for Non-payment, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (it may be cloaked as it will) is a great diſcredit to the Acceptant.</p>
               <p>XVII. If the Acceptant pay a part of the Bill, and promiſe the reſt in a few dayes, within the Reſpit dayes, if he do not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that time ſatisfie the whole, the Poſſeſſor may proteſt for the whole, and is not obliged to return what he hath received back again to the Acceptant; but he muſt obſerve the Laws of Exchange, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Drawer, &amp;c. the Rechange and Charges, &amp;c. for the Remainder that was unſatisfied.</p>
               <p>XVIII. If an Acceptant is unable or unwilling to pay his accepted Bill, and the Poſſeſſor is forced to proteſt againſt him, and he returns anſwer, that he is willing and ready to pay part, and that the Poſſeſſor may for the reſt proteſt and return the Bill if he pleaſe; then the Poſſeſſor does very fooliſhly if he refuſe to receive what is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60840:75"/>to him, be it more or leſs, but yet he muſt proteſt for the whole.</p>
               <p>XIX. If an Acceptant of a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, after he hath accepted, ſhould prove inſolvent, or be publickly reported to be fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that he abſent himſelf from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or if there be juſt ground of fear and jealouſies that he may be inſolvent before it may fall due, the Poſſeſſor of the Bill may demand better ſecurity by a Notary Publick, and if that be not given, he may proteſt and ſend the Proteſt away by the next Poſt; and when the Bill is due, if not paid, you muſt proteſt again for Non-Payment, ſo doth <hi>Marius</hi> adviſe.</p>
               <p>XX. The ſame <hi>Marius</hi> adviſeth, that all Proteſts be made in the day time between Sun and Sun, and if it can be while the Shops are open, or not before they are open, <hi>i. e.</hi> between ſix and ſix a Clock in Summer, and between Sun and Sun in Winter.</p>
               <p>XXI. If a Bill proteſted for Non-Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be returned on the Drawer, and the Drawer diſcharge the ſame, then both he himſelf and the Acceptant are diſcharged from the Remitter and Poſſeſſor, or any other, but yet the Acceptant (if he accepted) is not diſcharged from the Drawer, but the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60840:76"/>Drawer hath the ſame Right and Law againſt the Acceptant that the Poſſeſſor or Remitter would have had, if the Drawer had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged it.</p>
               <p>XXII. Acceptants by acceptance ſimply do ſo far oblige themſelves, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Debtors thereby, that if the Drawer fail, they have no Remedy or Redreſs againſt any of the Endorſers; and the caſe is the ſame, if the Acceptant or any other accept <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> in honour of an Endorſer, or any other Perſon, if that Endorſer fail and be inſolvent before or afterwards.</p>
               <p>XXIII. If the Acceptant of a Bill fail, the Poſſeſſor is not obliged to wait till the laſt Reſpit day before he proteſt, but may proteſt ſooner when he pleaſes, after he knows of his failure, and muſt preſently give advice thereof to the Remitter, or elſe the Drawer is not obliged to pay Intereſt and Charges.</p>
               <p>XXIV. Bills of Exchange proteſted, or to be proteſted, are liable to no Arreſts or Attachments, but if arreſted, the Notary Publick may make a Proteſt, or if proteſt, deliver the Proteſt, or the Copy thereof, and the Bills to the Poſſeſſor, if he demand them, and the Poſſeſſor notwithſtanding any
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60840:76"/>arreſt may do therewith what he pleaſeth, unleſs the Acceptant will make appear, that he either hath or will pay the Value according to the Tenure of the Bill.</p>
               <p>XXV. There is nor can be any danger by proteſting Bills two or three dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reſpit dayes are expired; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Reſpit dayes are not certain in many places, its therefore ſureſt to proteſt by times, than to hazard the loſs of the Law by too long a delay.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. VVHen a Bill for Non-Payment is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, then any man may freely, even he that ſuffered the Bill to be proteſted, or he that did proteſt, pay and ſatisfie the ſame <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of the Drawer or Endorſer.</p>
               <p>II. An Acceptant that hath freely and willingly accepted a Bill cannot afterwards
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60840:77"/>ſatisfie the ſame <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of an Endorſer, becauſe he as Acceptant is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obliged to the Endorſer; but an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant, that hath not yet accepted the Bills, may diſcharge thoſe Bills in honour of the Endorſer or the Drawer, as if he were a third Perſon unconcerned.</p>
               <p>III. When an Acceptant is drawn upon for the Drawer's account, and the Drawer hath not made Proviſion for the diſcharge thereof, and is fearful that he ſhall have ſome trouble in re-imburſing himſelf, in this caſe he need not freely and willingly pay the Bills that he freely and willingly accepted, but may proteſt the Bills for Non-Payment, and then he himſelf, or any other for him, may pay them <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> cauſing the Right and Title to be transferred to him to proſecute the Drawer, by which means he may more eaſily convince the Drawer, and prevail with him to make Reſtitution of the Value he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, than perſwade him to re-imburſe what he hath paid for him.</p>
               <p>IV. No man muſt pay a <hi>Bill ſupra Proteſt</hi> for Non-Payment, before he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before a Notary Publick (either the ſame that made the Proteſt, or any other) in whoſe honour he diſcharges the Bill, whereof the Notary, after the Proteſt, or
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60840:77"/>in another particular Inſtrument or Act, muſt give an account to the Parties concerned.</p>
               <p>V. He that pays a Bill <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> doth immediately ſucceed the Poſſeſſor in the Right and Title thereof, although there be no formal tranſport thereof, nor no <hi>Ceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Actionis</hi> from the Poſſeſſor to the Payer; yet to prevent all diſputes, its more adviſable for the Payer <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> that he cauſe the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of the Bill to make a Tranſport of his Action and Right to him formally.</p>
               <p>VI. The Poſſeſſor of a Bill proteſted for Non-Payment, is not obliged to accept of the Payment of a third Perſon <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> either in honour of the Drawer, or any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer, unleſs he demonſtrate and declare, that the honour of that <hi>Bill</hi> was eſpecially recommended to him, and then he is fully obliged to accept of the Payment abſolutely, as if the true Acceptant had paid it.</p>
               <p>VII. The Poſſeſſor of a Bill that accepts of Payment <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> is obliged to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Right to the Payer, as well againſt the Acceptant, as againſt the Drawer, or any Endorſer, in whoſe honour he pays the Bill, yea, and againſt all others againſt whom the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of the Bill, by virtue of that Bill hath any Right.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60840:78"/>
               <p>VIII. But if the <hi>Bill</hi> proteſted be endorſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Poſſeſſor's</hi> Correſpondent, by whom the <hi>Bill</hi> was ſent to him, then the <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> if circumſpect, will accept of no payment in honour of the Endorſements, but under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs condition, That the Payer ſhall have no Redreſs or Remedy againſt the ſaid Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent.</p>
               <p>IX. The <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of a <hi>Bill,</hi> proteſted for Non-payment, is not obliged to part with the <hi>Bill</hi> out of his hands to the Payer <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> before he be actually ſatisfied and paid.</p>
               <p>X. He that honours a <hi>Bill,</hi> proteſted for Non-payment, in honour of the Drawer, hath no Remedy againſt the Endorſers.</p>
               <p>XI. He that honours a <hi>Bill,</hi> proteſted for Non-payment, in honour of an Endorſer, hath his Redreſs and Remedy not only againſt the ſaid Endorſer, but againſt all that were before him, and the Drawer alſo, but he hath no Action, Law nor Right againſt the Endorſers, that follow the Endorſer for whom he was willing to pay the <hi>Bill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. When divers or ſeveral Perſons preſent themſelves to honour a proteſted <hi>Bill</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60840:78"/>for Non-payment, then he is chiefly to be accepted that offers to pay in honour of the Drawer, and next to him, he that offers to pay for the earlieſt Endorſer.</p>
               <p>XIII. When a <hi>Bill</hi> is paid <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> in honour of the Endorſer, and the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant counſels or adviſeth him, that there is another (or he voluntarily offers himſelf) that will diſcharge the <hi>Bill</hi> in honour of an earlier Endorſer, or of the Drawer, and this before the Payer hath re-imburſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by re-drawing, then the firſt Payer is obliged to accept of the Payment of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and to tranſport his Right to him, but the ſecond Payer will be obliged to pay not only all the former Charges, but half Proviſion alſo.</p>
               <p>XIV. Men ought to be circumſpect in accepting <hi>Bills</hi> or paying <hi>Bills</hi> in honour of the Drawer, and yet more circumſpect when its done in honour of an Endorſer, and ſhould in no wiſe accept any <hi>Bills</hi> or pay any <hi>Bills ſupra Proteſt,</hi> but in honour of thoſe with whom they are well acquainted, and have had good Correſpondence, &amp; whoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and Generoſity is ſufficiently known.</p>
               <p>XV. If the Acceptant be ſufficient to pay the <hi>Bills,</hi> and yet ſuffers them to be proteſted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60840:79"/>for Non-payment, then he that will pay in honour of the Drawer, muſt or ſhould dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently enquire of the Acceptant, what Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Reaſons he hath to ſuffer the <hi>Bills</hi> he accepted to be proteſted; for the Reaſons may be ſuch as might diſſwade others from paying them <hi>ſupra Proteſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVI. If the Proteſt for Non-payment be ſent away, then its not in any wiſe adviſable for any man to offer to pay the <hi>Bill ſupra Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi> though the <hi>Bill</hi> be not ſent away, unleſs the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Bill</hi> will give ſufficient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the Reſtitution, in caſe the Drawer or Endorſer have re-paid the Value and Charges, &amp;c. upon the preſenting of the Proteſt, or otherwiſe agreed with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters.</p>
               <p>XVII. Circumſpection is alſo required in the Payment of Bills <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> that are made payable to order, and after ſome dayes ſight, when there hath been any negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in demanding Acceptance; and above all, men ſhould be fearful to meddle with the Payment of any Bills <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> that were not proteſted in time, within the dayes of Reſpit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB,</hi> As much Circumſpection is here ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the honouring of Bills for <hi>Non-Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> as was for the honouring of Bills for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60840:79"/>
                  <hi>Non-Acceptance,</hi> whereof we have treated, Chap. 14.</p>
               <p>XVIII. When an Accepted Bill is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted for Non-payment, and the Acceptant is ſufficient, then there can be little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in paying and diſcharging the ſame <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> becauſe if neither the Drawer nor Endorſers will nor can re-pay the Value and the Charges, &amp;c. yet the Acceptant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains obliged.</p>
               <p>XIX. A Circumſpect Acceptant reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for Reaſons known to himſelf, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Bills to be proteſted for Non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to return them on the Drawer, will ſeek for ſome known and truſty Friend that ſhall pay the Bill <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> in honour of the Drawer, and receive the Tranſport of the Action and Right from the <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> and by him ſeek his Redreſs on the Drawer.</p>
               <p>XX. If a Bill <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> in honour of the Drawer or Endorſer be paid, then the Payer uſually (if he hath no effects in his hands) redraws the ſame directly on him, for whoſe account he paid, and he augments the Sum mentioned in the Bill, with the Charges, Courtagie, Poſtidge and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:60840:80"/>
               <p>XXI. When he that payes <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, hath Revalued or Redrawn, he is obliged with the advice of the draught, to ſend the proteſted, and by him paid Bills of Exchange, and the Proteſt, and the Inſtrument of his offering to diſcharge the ſame, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance for the diſcharge thereof, to his Friend, to be ſhown to the Perſon in whoſe honour he paid, and to demand the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Payment of his Bills on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>XXII. If a Bill be paid <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of the Drawer, with the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any or all the Endorſers, then the Payer is obliged to ſend the Proteſt, &amp;c. to all and as many of them as he will keep ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to him, and to adviſe them, that to ſpare them trouble, and to prevent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Loſſes of the Rechange, he hath redrawn upon the Poſſeſſor, they remaining ſtill obliged —But ſuch an honourer of a Bill doth diſtruſt the Drawer, and therefore will get ſmall Thanks for his Pains.</p>
               <p>XXIII. The Drawer or Endorſers of a Bill proteſted for Non-payment, and <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt honoured by a known Friend, or not, being Redrawn upon, for the Re-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement, is obliged to accept and honour
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60840:80"/>the Bill with punctual Payment, or elſe he is Guilty of the greateſt Incivility and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude imaginable, and if he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, he may be compelled to it, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſe all the Charges and Damage, the Drawer having got a tranſport of the Right of the firſt Poſſeſſor to himſelf.</p>
               <p>XXIV. If a <hi>Drawer</hi> make any difficulty, alledging that his Bill was accepted, and that therefore the <hi>Remitter</hi> muſt ſeek his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs on the Acceptant, &amp;c. yet the <hi>Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is obliged firſt to try what the <hi>Drawer</hi> can do, and then to look to the Acceptant.</p>
               <p>XXV. If a <hi>Drawer</hi> ſuſpect that his Bill, though accepted, will for Non-payment be proteſted, he muſt look about to procure ſome that will, in honour of himſelf, accept and pay the Bill, and to receive from the Poſſeſſor a ceſſion of his Action and Right againſt the <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Acceptant,</hi> and ſo by him endeavour to procure right of the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant;</hi> for upon refuſal, Execution lies always ready.</p>
               <p>XXVI. He that hath accepted a Bill <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of the <hi>Endorſer</hi> or <hi>Drawer,</hi> and pays the ſame at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he is accounted alſo to have paid
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60840:81"/>the ſame <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt; and its unneceſſary to make a new Proteſt for Non-payment, though now Uſe and Cuſtom hath brought it almoſt into Faſhion in ſome places, that Bills proteſted for Non-acceptance, muſt alſo be proteſted for Non-payment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IN caſe the Acceptant do not diſcharge his accepted Bills at the day appointed, then the Bills with the Proteſt muſt be returned.</p>
               <p>NB, ſome hold, that its not neceſſary to ſend the Bill back again, if the Drawer live at a great diſtance, or have no certain place of abode; Others the contrary. But if the <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> underſtand one another well, and the <hi>Drawer</hi> would force the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant to the payment, then let him give Security to the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> conditionally, if he cannot procure payment of the Acceptant,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60840:81"/>to ſtand obliged for the Sum, and then let him neglect to proteſt on the laſt Reſpit day, whereby having loſt his Redreſs on the <hi>Drawers</hi> and <hi>Endorſers,</hi> he hath only the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant to look upon, and by virtue of the Proteſt can force him to the Payment, if he be able.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of an endorſed accepted Bill, proteſted for Non-payment, and not diſcharged <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, hath his Redreſs on the Drawer and all the Endorſers.</p>
               <p>III. Its uſual, that the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of ſuch a Bill, proteſted for Non-payment, and not <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt diſcharged, doth redraw the value on him, from whom he received the Bill, whether he be the firſt Remitter, or any other Endorſer; but if the ſame that ſent him the Bill be not to be found, or be fail'd, or if it be more convenient for the <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> or to pleaſure a later Endorſer, he may well draw the value upon ſome other earlier Endorſer, and demand of him, or of the Drawer, reſtitution of the Value and the Charges; and in caſe of refuſal compel him to it.</p>
               <p>IV. But however, the Perſon from whom he received, or with whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated the Bill, is obliged to make Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60840:82"/>and he again hath his Redreſs on the Acceptant, Drawer, or any other earlier Endorſer.</p>
               <p>V. The <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of ſuch a Bill, muſt not directly demand Reſtitution from the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without firſt giving notice of the Non-payment and Proteſt to the Endorſers, leſt he loſe his Redreſs on them.</p>
               <p>VI. Its the duty of the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of ſuch a Bill, not only in caſe of Proteſts for Non-acceptance, but alſo for Non-payment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly without delay, to adviſe the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof, and to ſend Copies of the Proteſt to him, that he may ſecure the Reſtitution from the Drawer.</p>
               <p>VII. The <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Bill</hi> is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged inſtantly, without delay, to demand reſtitution of the Drawer, or Endorſer, or Remitter; nor muſt he for his own pleaſure, or at the Acceptants requeſt, neglect to ſend the <hi>Proteſt</hi> by the firſt Poſt after, and the <hi>Bill</hi> by the ſecond Poſt at furtheſt.</p>
               <p>VIII. In caſe the laſt Reſpit day be on a Poſt day, and Payment is demanded, to which the Acceptant anſwers, that it either is already done in Bank, or will that day be done, then the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> may delay to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60840:82"/>or having proteſted, to ſend it away by that Poſt; and on the contrary, if he ſuſpect the Acceptant or the Drawer, he may proteſt, and ſend the <hi>Proteſt</hi> away that ſame Poſt-day.</p>
               <p>IX. The <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> does not well, if he in ſuch a caſe, having proteſted before, or on the laſt Reſpit day, re-draw the ſame on that day, or ſend the <hi>Bill</hi> with the <hi>Proteſt</hi> away.</p>
               <p>X. But if the Acceptant, after the laſt Reſpit day, or any other third Perſon offer to pay the <hi>Bill,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> hath ſent the <hi>Bill</hi> and <hi>Proteſt</hi> away, he is not obliged to accept of their offers, eſpecially if he hath redrawn the Value; though he may have the <hi>Bill</hi> and <hi>Proteſt</hi> yet by him.</p>
               <p>XI. No <hi>Bills</hi> of Exchange <hi>proteſted,</hi> or to be <hi>proteſted,</hi> can be arreſted in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries hands, and the Notaries may, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch an Arreſt, (yea, and muſt if demanded) deliver the <hi>Bill</hi> with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> to the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> to proceed therein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure, except only that the Acceptant can ſufficiently demonſtrate that he hath paid the Sum fully, in which caſe the Notaries are bound to obey the Arreſt.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:60840:83"/>
               <p>XII.

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> To what the Drawer and Endorſers of Bills returned with Proteſt for Non-Payment, are further obliged to.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. THe Acceptant cannot be compelled to the Payment of a Bill unleſs by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; nor the Drawer or Endorſer to the Reſtitution, unleſs the Bill be returned with the Proteſt for Non-payment.</p>
               <p>II. The Drawer or Endorſer is obliged at the preſenting of the Proteſt (if it be in all the Circumſtances rightly made, and in the right time, according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of the place where the Payment was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60840:83"/>to be made) to give preſent and punctual ſatisfaction, which conſiſts in the Re-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Value, the Re-change and Charges, as Courtagie, Proviſion, and for the Proteſt and Poſtidge.</p>
               <p>III. When the Value of the Bill is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, augmented with all the Charges, then the Drawer and Endorſer are obliged to pay the re-valued Sum, though the ſame were not taken at the loweſt Courſe; and ſo in like manner when the Re-valuer or Re-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath negotiated a Bill with any other, which is payable to a third Perſon, but if he diſcount the Sum, and make it payable to the Remitter, then the Drawer or Endorſer need pay no more than according to the Courſe that day; and if that day the Proteſt was made, and the Poſt after there was no Courſe made upon ſight, but at time or uſance, then the Courſe upon time muſt be reduced to the Courſe upon ſight by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting a reaſonable Intereſt from the Courſe upon time, unleſs the Drawer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter could agree that the time ſhould run out before the Payment ſhould be demanded.</p>
               <p>IV. The Drawer and Endorſer are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in the Reſtitution of the Value, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Courſe of Exchange, though the full Sum of the Bill be not re-drawn.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:60840:84"/>
               <p>V. They are alſo obliged to re-pay Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, Poſtidge, and the Charges of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, though the full Sum be not re-drawn.</p>
               <p>VI. The Proviſion that the Drawer muſt pay for a proteſted Bill of his, is due half to the Proteſter, and half to the Remitter, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>VII. The Drawer or Endorſer are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to pay no more than according to the Courſe of Exchange, though the Re-draught be at a lower Courſe than when it was firſt drawn or endorſed.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Drawer of a Bill payable to order is no further obliged (though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted Bill were endorſed in ſeveral places, and returned the ſame wayes) than in the Payment of the Re-draught from the place where the Bill was to be paid, directly to the place where it was drawn, and at ſuch a Courſe as it was at the time of proteſting; and ſo the Endorſers are no further obliged than in the Courſe of Rechange from the place where it was to be paid, to the place directly where it was endorſed by them.</p>
               <p>IX. When a Bill is in one place, ſucceſſively endorſed by ſeveral Perſons, and is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Proteſt to the laſt Endorſer, he is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60840:84"/>obliged to make ſatisfaction inſtantly, either himſelf or by ſome other Endorſer before him, or for him; and if he pay, and ſatisfie it himſelf, he is not then to demand Proviſion or Charges of the other Endorſers or Drawer in the ſame place, more than he himſelf hath actually paid.</p>
               <p>X. The Remitter or Poſſeſſor of a Bill prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted for non-payment is not oblig'd neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to compel the Drawer or Endorſer of a Bill to the Reſtitution, if he had rather ſeek his Redreſs on the Acceptant; and ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he is not neceſſarily obliged to look on the Acceptant, when he had rather ſeek his Redreſs on the Drawer or Endorſer, nor is he obliged to give them any time for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but may, when the Payment is not punctual, proceed againſt which of them he pleaſes, by Arreſting either their Perſons, or Goods, or both.</p>
               <p>XI. No Drawer or Endorſer is obliged to make Reſtitution at the ſight of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt alone, nor at the ſight of the Proteſt and the unaccepted Bill, when one of them hath been accepted, but he is obliged to give ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient caution and ſecurity to the Remitter at the ſight of the Proteſt alone, and to make Payment when both the accepted Bill and the Proteſt are preſented.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:60840:85"/>
               <p>XII. No Drawer or Endorſer is obliged at the preſenting of the Proteſt for Non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made before the laſt Reſpit day, when the Acceptant hath not abſolutely denyed payment, but only deſir'd delay till the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpit day, to give any caution or ſecurity, much leſs to re-pay the Re-change and Charges, &amp;c. if he can prove that the Acceptant (or a third Perſon <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi>) would on the laſt reſpit day pay the ſame, and that the Bill had effectually been paid if it had remained at the place of Payment ſo long.</p>
               <p>XIII. No Drawer or Endorſer is obliged to pay the Re-change of an accepted Bill, if the Proteſt were not made within the limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dayes of Reſpit.</p>
               <p>XIV. If the Payment of a Bill be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on the day it becomes due, and the Acceptant is commanded by Authority of the Magiſtrate not to pay it, yet the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> may proteſt for Non-payment, and the Drawer is obliged to pay the Rechange; but if for any Accidental Occurences the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be demanded, (as perhaps a City may be beſieged, and the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> is not allowed to go in to make his Demands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) then the Drawer is not obliged to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but the whole Sum runs upon the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60840:85"/>
                  <hi>Riſco</hi> and hazard of the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> or <hi>Remitter</hi> of the Bill.</p>
               <p>XV. If the Endorſer unadviſedly or ignorantly makes Reſtitution for a Bill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted for Non-payment after the Reſpit dayes, and the Drawer refuſeth to make him ſatisfaction, then the Endorſer hath no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, but to demand Reſtitution again from the Perſon to whom he paid the Value.</p>
               <p>XVI. The Drawer, or he that makes Reſtitution for a Bill proteſted for Non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within the dayes of Reſpit, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to demand <hi>Ceſſionem Actionis</hi> from the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> againſt the <hi>Acceptant,</hi> whom he may compel to give ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>XVII. It many times happens, that the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of an accepted Bill, proteſted for Non-payment, is by the <hi>Drawer,</hi> after Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution made, deſired under pretence and proteſt of the <hi>Drawer's</hi> refuſal to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, to compel the <hi>Acceptant</hi> to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; but it is very unhandſome for a third Perſon unconcern'd to receive <hi>Ceſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Actionis,</hi> and ſeek his Redreſs on the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. When the Drawer hath paid the Bill that was returned with Proteſt for
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60840:86"/>Non-payment, the Drawer is thereby freely diſcharged againſt all Parties to whom the ſaid Bill was made payable, either immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Bill, or mediately by Aſſignments, were they never ſo many; nor can any one any way moleſt or trouble the Drawer, nor can any one of them proſecuted the Accepter on that account any further; but yet the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter is not totally diſcharged if the <hi>Bill</hi> were for the Drawers or any others account, to whom the Acceptant ſhould be reſponſible.</p>

Though the Poſſeſſor of a Bill hath no redreſs upon the Drawer, if he after the days of reſpit cauſe the Proteſt (for Non-payment of an accepted Bill) to be entred, yet this notwithſtanding, if the Drawer be yet in credit, the Acceptant cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by Arreſts or Attaches, to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, till the Bill, ſent with Proteſt to the Drawer, is again returned on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant.</p>
               <p>III. A Bill made payable for the account of the Drawer himſelf, not paid at the due time, but proteſted for Non-payment, need not be returned on the Drawer, but he may inſtantly without delay, compel the Drawer to make ſatisfaction by Arreſts and Attaches where-ever he finds him.</p>
               <p>IV. An Acceptant of an endorſed Bill, proteſted for Non-payment, cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt by Arreſts and Attaches, if any one, or all the Endorſers refuſe to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, unleſs the Drawer himſelf alſo refuſe to do it, and this be proved by good Evidence.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:60840:87"/>
               <p>V. The Acceptant of a Bill, returned with Proteſt for Non-payment, and again returned on the Acceptant, is only obliged to pay the Exchange and Rechange, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Poſtige, and no other Charges more.</p>
               <p>VI. The Exchange is reckoned, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe at ſight at that time, and in that place where the Proteſt is made, to the place where the Payment muſt be made by the Drawer, and if it be not paid there, then the ſum is again increaſed, the Proviſion and Poſtige being again added, and then the courſe is reckoned again upon the whole ſum, according as it ſhall be at that time and place upon ſight, to the place where the Bill is to be paid, and the Acceptant is obliged to pay the Rechange, and all the Charges, although the Parcel was not effectually negotiated and redrawn, <hi>i. e.</hi> Rechange, Proviſion and Poſtidge muſt be twice paid, &amp;c. As,</p>
               <p>VII. Proviſion twice for the Exchange and Rechange.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Charges are no other than Poſtidge, and for the Proteſts, unleſs the <hi>Acceptant</hi> forced (by his delays and excuſes) the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Bill</hi> upon ſome unneceſſary
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60840:87"/>Charges, which the <hi>Acceptant</hi> is obliged to pay, but no extraordinary Charges, as for Travelling, Bribing and Spending, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IX. He is obliged to pay Intereſt, if he do not preſently without delay ſatisfie the returned Bill, which is to be reckoned from the day that the Bill was due upon, to the time of its diſcharge, and the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> may charge his Account with Intereſt after the rate of 8 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> which any Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor may charge his tedious Debtor with, when he payes not punctually at the time.</p>
               <p>X. Though the Notary Publick does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and in the Proteſt expreſs, That he proteſts for all Damages, &amp;c. that ſhall accrue, yet no <hi>Acceptant</hi> is obliged to make any other Loſs or Damage good, but what are above ſpecified, as the Rechange, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Proteſts and Poſtidge, in manner and form as before declared; nor can the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> with any Equity or Law compel the <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> to make good any loſs or damage that he pretends to have ſuſtained for want of punctual payment, as the fruſtrating of his Deſigns, the loſs of ſome convenient and profitable Opportunity, or any ſuch like thing.</p>
               <p>XI. No prudent man will <hi>ſupra</hi> proteſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60840:88"/>accept and ſatisfie any Bill that is returned unſatisfied from the Drawer, unleſs he hath expreſs order to do it in his honour.</p>
               <p>XII. Though the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of a Bill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted and returned from the <hi>Drawer</hi> unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, hath thereby Right and Law againſt the <hi>Acceptant,</hi> and may proceed againſt him, by Execution, Arreſt and Attach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he is not neceſſarily obliged thereto, but if he will he may, at the <hi>Acceptant's</hi> requeſt, ſpare him, and ſeek his regreſs again upon the firſt <hi>Drawer,</hi> unleſs he hath expreſs order to the contrary.</p>

               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:60840:88"/>
               <p>II. but in caſe the Friend will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly endorſe, or the Drawer for ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will not deſire it of his Friend, then its uſual and cuſtomary for that Friend to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>ſecunda</hi> or <hi>tertia</hi> Bill.</p>
               <p>III. He that doth ſubſcribe a <hi>ſecunda</hi> or <hi>tertia</hi> Bill, doth only ſubſcribe his Name under the Drawer's, without adding a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable more, and thereby he doth as fully and amply oblige himſelf as the principal Drawer doth.</p>
               <p>IV. No Mackeler or Broger muſt promiſe the Remitter, that any other Friends ſhall ſubſcribe the Drawer's <hi>ſecunda</hi> or <hi>tertia</hi> Bill, unleſs he know for certain that it will be ſo.</p>
               <p>V. If in the Contract the Drawer ſimply negotiate in his own Name, and does not promiſe that any other ſhould under-write for him, or the Remitter does not expreſly condition for it, then the Drawer is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged at the requeſt of the Remitter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure any to ſubſcribe his Bills.</p>
               <p>VI. By Subſcription of a <hi>ſecunda</hi> or <hi>tertia</hi> Bill, the Subſcriber doth only oblige himſelf to the Remitter, and to him to whom he gives the <hi>ſecunda</hi> or <hi>tertia</hi> Bill, by him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60840:89"/>thus if the Remitter or any other keep the <hi>tertia</hi> ſubſcribed Bill, and the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of the <hi>prima</hi> and <hi>ſecunda</hi> unſubſcribed would ſeek any redreſs upon him, he cannot for want of the <hi>tertia</hi> ſubſcribed Bill.</p>
               <p>VII. Becauſe the ſubſcribing of a <hi>ſecunda</hi> or <hi>tertia</hi> Bill is only for ſecurity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, and is to the diſpect and diſcredit of the Drawer, therefore not to leſſen the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the principal Drawer, the ſame is uſually concealed, not divulged, nor ought the ſubſcribed Bill to be ſent away to any other place.</p>
               <p>VIII. Becauſe the Bills drawn on <hi>Venice</hi> muſt be done directly, and made payable by ſome there, therefore ſome that give and take, remit and draw on one Exchange time, in one day, make uſe of this Method, they order their Drawer to make his Bills accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Direction, the Value from him received, and for their ſecurity they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>ſecunda</hi> or <hi>tertia</hi> Bill; but a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and underſtanding Drawer will judge himſelf unobliged to make any Bills, but ſuch as make the Value to be received of the Remitter, to prevent the ſubſcribing of the <hi>ſecunda</hi> or <hi>tertia Bill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. The Bills ſubſcribed by another being
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60840:89"/>ſatisfied, ſhould be again delivered to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Drawer, who in the <hi>prima</hi> Bill acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to have received the Value of him, and the Remitter is very imprudent if he pay the Value to the Subſcriber, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with him, and looks more upon the Subſcriber than the principal Drawer.</p>
               <p>X. He that ſubſcribes a <hi>ſecunda</hi> or <hi>tertia</hi> Bill, does wiſely if he on the day of Payment enquire of the Poſſeſſor or Remitter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bill be ſatisfied or no, that he for his ſecurity may have the ſubſcribed Bill cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or re-delivered.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of Exchanging for Account, and in the Name of a Third Perſon.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. EXchange is made in the Name and for Account of a third Perſon when any one doth by the Order, full Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of another, which is called among Merchants <hi>Procuration;</hi> and thus Bills may be drawn, ſubſcribed, endorſed and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not in the Name or for the Account of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60840:90"/>him that doth draw, ſubſcribe, endorſe and accept, but in the Name and for the Account of him that authorized him.</p>
               <p>II. Great prudence is to be uſed in giving any man full Power and Authority by Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to draw or accept Bills of Exchange; for he that is credited ſo much, is credited with the Credit and Eſtate of him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, his Well-fare is in his Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors hands.</p>
               <p>III. A prudent Merchant will be prudent and circumſpect in granting any ſuch full Power to any one, and will adviſe all his Correſpondents (on whom his Procurator ſhall have occaſion to draw, &amp;c.) with and under his own Hand, that he hath granted to ſuch and ſuch a one ſuch a full Power to draw in his Name <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire them to give credit to his Subſcription, till he revoke and evacuate his ſaid full Power, or till ſuch a time as he ſhall limit.</p>
               <p>IV. He that by Procuration in the Name of another, <hi>Bonâ ſide,</hi> does negotiate, draw, endorſe, ſubſcribe and accept Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, by under-writing his own Name, and his Quality, does thereby as effectually oblige his Principal (himſelf being in the mean time not in the leaſt obliged) as if he himſelf had ſubſcribed.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:60840:90"/>
               <p>V. He that negotiates, draws, accepts, endorſeth, &amp;c. Bills of Exchange in the Quality of a full Power and Procurator, in the Name of another, is obliged at all times to prove his Quality, and if he cannot do that, nor hath that full Power he pretends to, is not only himſelf obliged to perform all that he hath negotiated with others in the Name of a third Perſon, but (if I may add my private Opinion) is liable to be ſeverely puniſhed as a Knave and a Cheat, for preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which he had not.</p>
               <p>VI. If any draw or accept by Procuration, and have not that full Power they pretend to, they do not thereby oblige the Perſon whoſe Name they make uſe of, unleſs it can be proved, that ſuch a Perſon hath given them ſuch a full Power.</p>
               <p>VII. A prudent Remitter will receive no Bills, nor a prudent Poſſeſſor accept of no Acceptance that is ſubſcribed by the Wife of the Drawer or Accepter, or by their Servants or any other, as having full Power, unleſs he or they produce the full Power, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Procuration, or be every way as able and ſufficient as the Drawer or Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60840:91"/>
               <p>VIII. A prudent <hi>Remitter</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of a Bill will look narrowly to this, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator</hi> be ſufficiently impowered, and that the full Power be not antiquated out of date, or recalled; and in this caſe it were very neceſſary and advantagious to all Dealers by Exchange, that every Procurator ſhould cauſe his Inſtrument of Procuration to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in ſome publick and known place, that their ſufficiency and continuance may the better be known.</p>
               <p>IX. He that doth negotiate Bills, &amp;c. as a Procurator, ſhould before he conclude the Parcel, expreſly condition that the Bills ſhall be ſubſcribed by him, as having full Power and Authority from the principal Drawer; and if this be not expreſly agreed upon, the Remitter is not obliged to take ſuch Bills, nor to ſearch into the Validity of his full Power, or the like, but may refuſe to give him Moneys, or receive his Bills, if he ſo pleaſe.</p>
               <p>X. The <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of a Bill muſt accept of the Acceptance of a Procurator, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Procuration expreſly declare, that all Bills by him accepted are for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Principal, or eſpecially, that ſuch and ſuch Bills as the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> hath, are for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60840:91"/>his account; but if the Procuration be not clear nor expreſs in this, then he is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to accept of any Acceptance from any that he doth not look upon as ſufficient.</p>
               <p>XI. He that hath a full Power to draw ſimple Bills of Exchange in the Name and for the Account of a third Perſon, hath alſo Power to draw in and endorſe all Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change that are made payable to the order of his Principal.</p>
               <p>XII. <hi>Marius</hi> aſſerts, That a Merchant's Word or Letter to his Wife, Friend, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or other, to accept Bills of Exchange, is not ſufficient, without an Inſtrument and formal full Power, to that end there muſt be Hand and Seal, and Witneſſes to prove it, if need be.</p>
               <p>XIII. But if there be no ſuch Inſtrument, if the Wife, Friend or Servant in his abſence have formerly uſually accepted his Bills, and he, when he hath returned Home, hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereof, and this can be proved, it will come very cloſe to the Matter, and be near upon as good as a legal and formal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. THe meaning of this Title is thus; When he that is drawn upon (or the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant) dwells not in the ſame place where the Bill is to be paid, but yet the Acceptant is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to bring his Monyes to that place where the Bill is to be paid, thus; Bills are drawn on <hi>Briſtol</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> i. e. the Acceptor dwells in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but the Payment muſt be made in <hi>London,</hi> againſt which time the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant muſt have his Moneys ready at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Thus alſo Exchanges are made on <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſingen</hi> in <hi>Middlebrough,</hi> on <hi>Enchuyſen</hi> and other Cities of the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> on <hi>Bruſſells</hi> in <hi>Antwerp, Lubecke</hi> in <hi>Hambrough, Lions, Roan,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Paris, Valentia,</hi> in <hi>Madrid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>II. The Remitter is not obliged to take Bills drawn upon one that dwells not in the place where the Bill is to be paid, without an Addreſs, eſpecially when the Bills are
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60840:92"/>made payable at ſo many dayes ſight, or at Uſance (if Uſance be reckoned after ſight) except this Condition be expreſly by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to.</p>
               <p>III. The addreſs of a Bill of Exchange, is a direction, made either by the Drawer or the Acceptant, ſimply declaring by whom, and where the Payment ſhall be ready, at the time appointed, and to whom the Poſſeſſor may addreſs himſelf in his abſence, as if he were preſent.</p>
               <p>IV. He to whom the Bill is addreſſed by, the Drawer is not obliged to accept the Bill, nor he to whom the Acceptant makes the Addreſs to pay, nor to declare whether he will pay it or no, before the Bill become due, or any way to oblige himſelf for the Payment thereof: But</p>
               <p>V. He that hath the Bill, may demand acceptance of the Perſon to whom it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt, and in caſe he hath no Order, no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation, nor full Power from the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, to accept his Bills in his Name, and for his Account, the Poſſeſſor may deſire the Perſon, to whom it is addreſt (if a true and truſty Friend and Perſon) to ſend the Bill to the Acceptant to procure acceptance, or to return it with Proteſt, which the Perſon, on
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60840:93"/>whom its addreſt, is obliged to, or elſe the Poſſeſſor may, before the ſaid Perſon, make his Proteſt for Non-acceptance.</p>
               <p>VI. If the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> dare not truſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed with the Bill, that he may demand acceptance, or if the Drawer hath not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt the Bill at all, then its the duty of the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> to ſend the Bill, or cauſe it to be ſent, to ſome that lives at the place where the Acceptor dwells, to demand acceptance, or upon refuſal to Proteſt.</p>
               <p>VII. Its alſo uſual, when the <hi>Remitter</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> have no Correſpondent to ſend the Bill to, that lives at the place where the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor dwells, to deſire the Drawer to ſend the <hi>Prima</hi> Bill to the Acceptant, to procure acceptance, and to return it accepted to the <hi>Remitter</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> to which the Drawer is not obliged, yet cannot well refuſe, if he be aſſured of the real Honeſty of his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, and that he will accept his Bill.</p>
               <p>VIII. In caſe the Drawer do not in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, return the Bill accepted to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, as above, the Drawer is not obliged in ſuch a caſe, to give any further ſatisfaction to the Remitter, but the Remitter muſt look to it himſelf, and ſend the ſecond a Bill to ſome other, to procure acceptance, and to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60840:93"/>enquire whether the <hi>Prima</hi> be accepted or no, and if not, then the Acceptant muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Secunda,</hi> or a Proteſt muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt him.</p>
               <p>IX. But a prudent and circumſpect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter will not leave <hi>Prima</hi> Bill in the Drawers hands to procure acceptance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be ſufficiently aſſured of his Honeſty and Ability.</p>
               <p>X. When the Poſſeſſor of ſuch a Bill hath no Correſpondence at the place where the Acceptant lives, nor any who will take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the trouble to ſend it, nor dare the Remitter truſt the Drawer with it; or if the Bill be payable in a place where there is no Bank; or if the Bill muſt be paid in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Moneys <hi>per cuſſa,</hi> and not in Bank, then its uſual for the Poſſeſſor to adviſe the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant by Letter, that he hath ſuch and ſuch a Bill on him, and deſire him to return An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, whether he accept the ſame to pay it at the time or no; but if he get no Anſwer at all, or for anſwer, that he will not accept it, nor pay it, then the Poſſeſſor is obliged, to carry or ſend the Bill to that place, and there formally by a Notary Publick demand acceptance, and in caſe of refuſal to proteſt.</p>
               <p>XI. If the Acceptant be an Out-dweller,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60840:94"/>(<hi>i. e.</hi> dwells in another place than where the Bill muſt be paid) then when acceptance is demanded, uſually the Poſſeſſor deſires him to under-write to whom he muſt at the time addreſs himſelf for Payment. But the Acceptant is not obliged to do this; but on the contrary, the Poſſeſſor is obliged to give the Acceptant timely notice to whom the Bill muſt be paid, if it be a Bill that is payable to order.</p>
               <p>XII. When a Bill is made payable after ſight, or at uſance (and uſance be reckoned after ſight) by an Out-dweller, then the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant may date his Acceptance on the day it was demanded of him, if Acceptance be demanded directly from the place where the <hi>Bill</hi> was drawn; but if the <hi>Bill</hi> be firſt ſent to the place where the payment muſt be made, then the Acceptance ought to be dated the day of the arrival of the Bill at that place, and not on the day of its being preſented to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant in the place where he lives, if the Poſſeſſor will ſtand ſtrictly and preciſely for a day with the Acceptant, otherwiſe its no loſs or prejudice to the Poſſeſſor when the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance be dated, if within the juſt time.</p>
               <p>XIII. An Out-dweller muſt take ſpecial care that the Bill be diſcharged at the day in its due place, and muſt not wait till the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor adviſe him thereof.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60840:94"/>
               <p>XIV. When a Bill is payable by an Out-dweller to order, and not to a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Acceptant hath not ordered to whom the laſt aſſigned ſhall addreſs himſelf at the day of payment, then the Poſſeſſor (whoever he be) is obliged to give the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant timely notice to whom the Bill muſt be paid, that the Acceptant may within the Reſpit dayes return an anſwer, and make all due and neceſſary preparation to diſcharge the ſame.</p>
               <p>XV. If the Out-dweller at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed remit to the Poſſeſſor of his accepted Bill, in other Bills due at the ſame time with the Poſſeſſor's Bills, the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> is not obliged to demand Acceptance and Payment of thoſe Bills of his Acceptant, the Out-dweller, unleſs he hath Proviſion allowed him, becauſe he hath double Trouble in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his Moneys, and is obliged to keep a Correſpondence, and many other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences may follow; but when the Acceptant doth ſimply addreſs the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſon, to demand payment of him for the Bill, to him he is obliged to go to receive his payment, without any Proviſion.</p>
               <p>XVI. When an Out-dweller hath a Bill remitted to him, payable by an In-dweller,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60840:95"/>and the Out-dweller deſires his Acceptant at the day to ſend him his Moneys in Specie, or to remit him the value in other Bills, the In-dweller is not obliged to do this without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Proviſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVII. The <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of a Bill payable by an Out-dweller, muſt at the laſt day of Reſpit (if he get no payment) order a <hi>Notarius Publicus</hi> to enter a Proteſt for Non-payment, which Proteſt, though not made in preſence of the Perſon, nor at the Houſe of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant, is valid, and effectual to all intents and purpoſes, becauſe the Poſſeſſor of the Bill is not obliged to proteſt againſt an Out-dweller at his Houſe or Dwelling, nor to ſeek him out of the City or Town where the payment is to be made.</p>
               <p>The Out-dwellers of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> have made uſe of this Policy, to make the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Proteſt</hi> ineffectual on the day of Payment, pretending Ignorance of the Perſon to whom the payment is to be made; they at the place where the payment is to be made addreſs themſelves to a Notary Publick on the laſt reſpit day, and there declare to him, That ſuch and ſuch a Bill payable to order, by them accepted, is now become due, whereof none have demanded payment, they therefore proteſt for their readineſs and willingneſs to diſcharge the ſaid Bill, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60840:95"/>accordingly they cauſe a formal Proteſt to be drawn up, and ſend the ſame to the Drawer, to make uſe of the ſame againſt any other Proteſt for Non-payment; but this ſlight and cunning might be prevented if one general <hi>Office of Proteſts</hi> were erected, where all Proteſts ſhould be Regiſtered, and ſo every one might ſee to whom they are to apply themſelves.</p>
               <p>XVIII. <hi>Marius</hi> adds, That in caſe an Out-dweller refuſe Acceptance when the Bill is ſent to him, Proteſt may either be made at the Houſe of the Out-dweller, by the Perſon who was ordered to demand Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, or elſe at the place of Payment, the Friends Letter that demanded Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance being produced to the Notary is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ground the Proteſt upon, and ſo alſo in caſe of Non-payment.</p>
               <p>XIX. Though the Poſſeſſor be not obliged to ſeek for payment of an Out-dweller in any place than where the Bill is payable, and the Drawer or Acceptant hath addreſt it, yet he may, in caſe of Non-payment <hi>Executive proceede</hi> againſt the Acceptant in any place where he either finds his Goods or his Perſon. <hi>Sigiſm. Scaccia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XX. <hi>Scaccia.</hi> The Debtor by Exchange is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60840:96"/>obliged to bring his payment to the place of payment, though it be both chargeable and dangerous, and the <hi>Riſco</hi> and Expences are his own, and if the Debtor requeſt the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor to take his payment in any other place, and the Creditor conſent, the <hi>Riſco</hi> and the Charges muſt be paid and allowed by the Debtor, as they can agree; but if the Creditor receive his payment ſimply, then he takes the Hazard and Charges upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>XXI. So alſo the Creditor by Exchange is obliged to come to receive his Moneys at the place appointed, though it be both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive and hazardous to carry the Moneys Home, or to any other place where he would have it, but yet the Creditor can and may ſeek his Debtor in any place where he will, and there receive his payment, but then he cannot compel the Drawer to bear the Charges thereof, nor the <hi>Riſco.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of Exchanges in Commiſſion, in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and of Bills drawn on one Place over another Place.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I.</p>
               <p>EXchange to a place, over a place (or thorow a place) is, when Bills are not made payable, or remitted to the place or City directly where the Moneys are, or where the Remitter would have his Moneys, but on ſome other place, from whence the Value is to be re-drawn or re-remitted, to the place where the Money is to be paid, or where the Remitter would have his Moneys.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Exempli gratia:</label> 
                  <hi>A Drawer hath Moneys lying at</hi> London, <hi>and would gladly have it at</hi> Dantzick; <hi>the Drawer at</hi> Dantzick <hi>cannot directly draw his Moneys in from</hi> London, <hi>but firſt he draws on</hi> Hambrough <hi>or</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>and then orders his Friend at</hi> Hambrough <hi>or</hi> Amſterdam <hi>to draw upon</hi> London.</p>
               <p>II. The Reaſon of this kind of Exchange is either, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe directly there is no
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60840:97"/>Courſe of Exchange, or no Reſcount; Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe it may be more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and profitable thus to negotiate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, than directly.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Bills</hi> of this nature muſt be made firſt payable at the place, over or thorow which we draw, and to a Perſon dwelling in the place whereto the Remitter remits, whether he be Factor, Servant, or any elſe.</p>
               <p>IV. A <hi>Factor</hi> is one that ſerves another in Commiſſion, that obſerves his Principal's order, and acts according to his direction, for which he receiveth Proviſion.</p>
               <p>V. Proviſion is the Reward the Factor receives from his Principal, placing it to his account, for his trouble in correſponding and negotiating his Principal's Affairs, and in Bills of Exchange, hazarding his Credit.</p>
               <p>VI. Bills are negotiated for another when the Factor negotiates Bills in his own Name for the account of another; and by another, when the Bills are negotiated in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal's Name by another in Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>VII. Circumſpection and Prudence is very requiſit both in him that employes, and in him that ſerves others in Commiſſion; and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60840:97"/>a Merchants principal care in Exchanges (of this Nature eſpecially) is to ſee that he hath a ſufficient and able perſon to correſpond with, whether he draw and charge his Bills upon him, or remit his Bills to him; and he muſt not only have reſpect to his Ability, but to his Fidelity alſo; for an Able, but Knaviſh Correſpondent may ſerve his own Ends with the Moneys his Principal hath provided for him to diſcharge his Bills with, and ſuffer his Bills to return with proteſt (as <hi>Shaw</hi> and <hi>Snawdon,</hi> two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factors at <hi>Hambrough</hi> lately did.) But,</p>
               <p>VIII. A Factor that hath a Cordial, Real and Able Principal, who doth not uſe to abridge him of his Proviſion, is obliged to improve all his Abilities and Faculties in the true and faithful Service to him, and ſhould ſeek his Intereſt and Advantage as his own, (which the above-named Kn— never did) but if the Principal will not allow the uſual Proviſion, nor Poſtidge of Letters, nor Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagie, &amp;c. doth force his Factor one way or other, in the broad or the long, to make up his Disburſements, that he be no looſer.</p>
               <p>IX. Factors are obliged to a due Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, and by the firſt Poſt to give an account what they have negotiated in their <hi>Principal's</hi> Affairs, with all the Circumſtances
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60840:98"/>thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sum, the Courſe, what Conditions, and with whom.</p>
               <p>X. A prudent Principal will require of his Factor, though he hath credited him for the Bills negotiated, all the Circumſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the Factor is obliged to adviſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and in caſe he hath bought Goods, not only to declare who is his Chapman, but alſo in caſe he hath remitted Moneys for his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal's account, whereof he hath not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Bills, to give an account who is his Drawer; and ſo, if he hath drawn, who is his Remitter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. The Principal is obliged, as ſoon as he receives advice of any Negotiation done for his account by his Factor, to approve or diſprove of the ſame. But,</p>
               <p>XII. The Principal is not obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of all that his Factor doth; but if the Factor hath exceeded, or not followed his Orders punctually, though what he hath done were never ſo prudently managed, and with a good Intent, and in deſign for the moſt Advantage and Intereſt of the Principal, yet he may diſprove of the ſame, and if he can make any Damage appear, he may make him allow of it. But again, on the contrary, if the Factor hath followed Order, and hath
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60840:98"/>not tranſgreſſed nor exceeded his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then the Principal muſt approve of what is done by his Factor, though it turn not to account, but be greatly to his loſs.</p>
               <p>XIII. The loſs that is by Exchange (or any other concerns) if the Factor hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Orders ſtrictly and punctually, muſt be born by the Principal, for whoſe account the Negotiation is. And,</p>
               <p>XIV. Such a Factor that follows Orders, does not amiſs, though he fore-ſee, if he ſhould delay, or follow his own Conceptions, it would be more profitable for his Principal; and becauſe Exchanges are as variable as the Wind, and many times as if made, do preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate without any known Cauſe or Reaſon; therefore a Factor muſt not exerciſe his Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Philoſophical Faculty and Reaſon what is profitable or not for his Principal, but muſt follow Orders preciſely, if he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can, unleſs he certainly and abſolutely know, that it will be very prejudicial to his Principal ſo to do.</p>
               <p>XV. So then, Orders muſt ſtrictly, promptly and punctually be obſerved; for if a Factor act without, contrary to, or above Order, and his Principal approve not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Negotiation, whatever it was, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60840:99"/>done as for the Factor's account, and he muſt bear the loſs thereof. Yet,</p>
               <p>XVI. That known Rule, <hi>Volge Order, &amp; dort Qualick</hi> (i. e. follow Order, though to the Principal's loſs) is not alwayes to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, if the Factor ſee that by following Order he ſhall infallibly prejudice his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; for elſe he deals not honeſtly with his Principal, nor as for himſelf, but makes it plainly appear, that if he get his Proviſions he cares not whether his Principal ſink or ſwim, and its therefore beſt of all in ſuch caſes, for the Factor not to perform the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but wait for ſecond Orders if he can. For,</p>
               <p>XVII. A Principal hath not alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs againſt the Factor, for the loſs that doth enſue upon the not performing the Commiſſion, although the Facor hath promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to effect his Orders, and could have done it. But,</p>
               <p>XVIII. If he act any thing contrary to Order, he is alwayes obliged to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Damage and Intereſt, &amp;c. <hi>Sigiſm. Scaccia.</hi> pag. 391.</p>
               <p>XIX. If a Factor exceed his Order, its not in the power of the Principal to take ſo much of the Negotiation for his account as
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60840:99"/>his Orders were, and regulate the Affairs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, but he muſt either totally approve or diſprove of what the Factor hath done, and ſo either take all or none, as its done by the Factor.</p>
               <p>XX. If a Factor tranſgreſs his Limits and Orders, and give advice thereof to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and does conſent, that in caſe he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what he hath done, the whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair and Negotiation ſhall be reduced to his Orders, the Principal muſt content himſelf therewith, and be ſilent.</p>
               <p>XXI. The Factor that can and will not act to his Principal's advantage, cannot have a quiet and peaceable Conſcience; neither if he can negotiate his Affairs under or above the courſe and limits that he hath given (and ſo more to his advantage) can he detain the advantage for himſelf.</p>
               <p>XXII. A Factor renders himſelf ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if he do not adviſe his Principal of the true Courſe, but makes his Bills in a Forreign Denomination of Moneys. As for Inſtance: At <hi>Amſterdam</hi> the cuſtom is to exchange on <hi>Dantzick</hi> in <hi>Pounds Flemiſh,</hi> at 216 <hi>Groſhe Poliſh Money,</hi> or elſe for a <hi>pound Flemiſh:</hi> Now if the Bills made at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> be made in <hi>Poliſh Guilders</hi> and <hi>Groſhe,</hi> and not in <hi>Pounds Flemiſh,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:60840:100"/>it preſently reflects ſuſpition upon the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as if he had clipt the Courſe.</p>
               <p>XXIII. If one Factor hath one and the ſame Commiſſion from divers Principals, (whether in Exchange or other Affairs) without any Limitation, and he doth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform the ſaid Commiſſions, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in different Courſes, or at ſeveral Prices, that he cannot poſſibly reduce them to an equality, then its not contrary to Reaſon that he let that Principal, which to him is (or may prove) the beſt, have the moſt advantage; but yet he is obliged ſo to manage the Affairs that one Principal ſhall not have all the moſt advantagious, and the other all the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious Courſes and Prices; but he muſt endeavour to give all ſatisfaction and content as far as he can, that he may with confidence anſwer them all.</p>
               <p>XXIV. If a Factor hath Orders to one and the ſame purpoſe, from divers Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals; but one limits him to a Courſe and Price, the other not; if he can, and doth effect both their Commiſſions at the limitted Price and Courſe, or yet more for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, then its but Juſt that the Principal that gave not limits ſhould be preferred, if there be any advantage; becauſe if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion could not have been effected at the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60840:100"/>limitted Courſe and Price, he muſt have been content to have ſtood to and ſuffered the loſs.</p>
               <p>XXV. If a Factor hath a double Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from one Principal about drawing and remitting, he muſt not effect the one, unleſs he know how to effect the other (or if to buy and draw, he muſt not firſt draw and then buy) if he do the one without the other, its but an half effected Commiſſion, and will remain for the Factors Account, and he muſt bear the loſs.</p>
               <p>XXVI. The Factor may, and muſt place his Principal to account Courtagie and Mackeleridge, though the Commiſſion was effected without the Interpoſition of either Mackeler or Broger: But that Factor that to ſpare the Courtagie or Mackeleridge, and place it to his Principals Account, over and above his Proviſion, will rather yield to ſome things in the Conditions of the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation (as to give more, or take leſs) does not honeſtly and truly ſerve his Principal as he ought.</p>
               <p>XXVII. For Courtagie of Exchanges, whether in drawing or remitting, uſually one <hi>per mille</hi> is allowed for Proviſions for drawing and remitting, each half <hi>per cent;</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:60840:101"/>but for accepting and drawing both, but half <hi>per cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXVIII. A Factor that is a Creditor of the <hi>Principal,</hi> cannot detain that Moneys that the <hi>Principal</hi> hath remitted to him, with orders to remit again, or otherwiſe diſpoſe thereof for his Credit, and afterwards effect his Order, value again upon him, or buy upon Credit. <hi>Sigiſm. Scaccia.</hi> pag. 388.</p>
               <p>XXIX. If one Partner order another to draw upon him, or upon any other, its alwayes ſuppoſed he may do it either in his own Name alone, or in the Name of the Partnerſhip. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXX. If a <hi>Principal</hi> order his Factor to pay his Bills of Exchange, and place them to account of a third Perſon, it ſuppoſeth that the third Perſon is the Drawers Debtor, and if the Factor do accept of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſimply, it doth infer an Aſſignation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the third, or at leaſt <hi>Ceſſionem Nominis,</hi> of whom the Factor muſt ſeek his Re-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement. <hi>Sigiſm. Scaccia.</hi> fol. 387, and 480.</p>
               <p>XXXI. If a Factor hath order to pay Bills of Exchange, and to place them to the Drawer's Account; or if he pay <hi>ſupra Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:60840:101"/>for the Drawers Account, if the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will not Re-imburſe him, he may by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments and Arreſts proceed againſt the Drawer. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXII. The act of a <hi>quaſi</hi> Factor cannot prejudice the <hi>Principal,</hi> unleſs there can be produced the <hi>Principals</hi> Order. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXIII. No more then half <hi>per cent.</hi> is due for the Proviſion, both for the Labour and the <hi>Riſco,</hi> if the Factor ſtand <hi>del credere.</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi> allow but one third for both; more than this uſually and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Proviſion no Factor can with a good Conſcience take or demand, unleſs it be agreed upon expreſly; and being the <hi>Riſco</hi> cannot be weighed by Ounces and Pounds, and the moſt hazard may be when the leaſt appears, and <hi>contra,</hi> and that he is a Fool that will for ſo little Proviſion run an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hazard, therefore its ill to talk of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the <hi>Riſco.

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. <hi>DRawing</hi> in <hi>Commiſſion</hi> is either for the account of him on whom is drawn, who is the Acceptant, or for a third Perſon.</p>
               <p>II. When a Bill is drawn for the account of him on whom its drawn, prompt and punctual advice muſt be given him, <hi>What Sum</hi> (and diſtinctly in how many Bills) <hi>what Date, to Whom and When Payable, from Whom the Value, at What Courſe, and How much he will therefore be credited in the Account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Bills muſt not be drawn for the account of a third, without ſpecial order from the Perſon for whoſe account it is, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant ſhould alſo adviſe that he is ordered, and will accept for the account of that third Perſon, before the Drawer ought to draw.</p>
               <p>IV. When Bills are drawn for the account of a third, punctual advice by the Drawer to the Perſon for whoſe account, and alſo to the Accepter muſt be given.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:60840:102"/>
               <p>V. The Accepter muſt be adviſed, firſt, <hi>For whoſe Account, and then what Sum, in how many Bills, what Date, to whom, and when Payable, and from whom the Value.</hi> But to add the Courſe, is not neceſſary, unleſs the Exchange be made in a Forreign or Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary denomination of Moneys, wherein the Merchants of that place where the Bill is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able do not keep their Accounts, and when the value of the Bill muſt be paid, according to the courſe contracted for; As for inſtance, Exchanges are drawn at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> on <hi>Dantzick, Konigsbrough, Stockholme,</hi> &amp;c. in the Pound <hi>Flemiſh,</hi> at ſo many Groſh for the Pound <hi>Flemiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. The <hi>Principal</hi> for whoſe Account it drawn, muſt be adviſed of the Courſe, <hi>On Whom is drawn, What Sum, at What Time Payable, and the Value that he is Credited for:</hi> But to adviſe him how many Bills, or with whom is Negotiated, is not neceſſary at all.</p>
               <p>VII. In the making of Bills drawn for the account of a third, ſome Drawers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Method, in the concluding of the Bill they ſay, <hi>Make good Payment, and place it to Account of N. N.</hi> naming the Perſon, or the two firſt Letters of his Name and Sir-Name, to prevent and obviate an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60840:103"/>that the Accepter may make that he accepted not for ſuch an account, nor does ſatisfie the ſaid Bills for ſuch and ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but on the Drawers Account.</p>
               <p>VIII. Bills are, and may ſometimes be drawn upon another for a third Perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and yet the Accepter not know the Perſon at all; but ſuch draughts are alwayes made upon the Obligation and Faithfulneſs of the Drawer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for Example. A. B.</hi> is ſtraitned for Moneys, and <hi>C. D.</hi> his Friend can ſpare him none; but he hath Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with <hi>E. F.</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and he will ſerve his Friend with his Credit; but <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>E. F.</hi> are utter Strangers one to another, wherefore <hi>C. D.</hi> will value on his Friend <hi>E. F.</hi> ſuch a ſum of Moneys for the account of <hi>A. B.</hi> as he hath occaſion for, whereof he adviſeth <hi>E. F.</hi> and aſſures him that he will be caution for the punctual Re-imburſement. This method of Exchange is alſo practiſed, in caſe <hi>A. B.</hi> is Debtor to <hi>C. D.</hi> and <hi>A. B.</hi> cannot conveniently pay the Moneys, whereupon they both agree that <hi>C. D.</hi> may value on his own Correſpondent, <hi>E. F.</hi> with order to redraw the ſame on <hi>A. B.</hi> the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:60840:103"/>
               <p n="9">IX. Sometimes Bills are drawn for the account of a third, by the order of a fourth.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>As for Example.</label> 
                  <hi>A. B.</hi> of <hi>Antwerp</hi> hath order from <hi>C. D.</hi> of <hi>Madrid,</hi> to draw for his Account on <hi>E. F.</hi> of <hi>Hambrough,</hi> but <hi>A. B.</hi> of <hi>Antwerp</hi> finding no Reſcounter, orders <hi>G. H.</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to value the ſaid Moneys on <hi>Hambrough</hi> for the account of <hi>Madrid,</hi> by the order of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> which done, he ſhall remit the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to <hi>Antwerp;</hi> or elſe <hi>A.</hi> draws on <hi>B.</hi> with order to reimburſe himſelf, by drawing on <hi>C.</hi> for the account of <hi>D.</hi> but ſuch a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>B.</hi> ſhould not accept of, unleſs <hi>A.</hi> oblige himſelf; and when he draws on <hi>C.</hi> he muſt adviſe him, that he draws by the order of <hi>A.</hi> for the account of <hi>D.</hi> and alſo give advice to <hi>A.</hi> and the account alſo; but its not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, though this Negotiation be for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>D.</hi> that <hi>B.</hi> ſhould correſpond with <hi>D.</hi> about it, to which <hi>A.</hi> is obliged.</p>
               <p>X. When a Drawer in Commiſſion gives his Bills to any that do not punctually pay the Value, he is then obliged to procure the Value by rigour, and arreſting his Goods and Perſon, and may not give him any time or delay, but upon his own <hi>riſco</hi> and hazard; no, not a day longer than till the next Poſt.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60840:104"/>
               <p>XI. If a Drawer in Commiſſion give the Remitter any time for the payment of the Value, and hath thereby any advantage in the courſe, and placeth the advance to the Principals account; then the Principal upon advice thereof is obliged by the next return of the Poſt to approve or diſprove thereof, and if he be not ſatisfied with the conditions, he muſt let the Drawer have the advantage, and anſwer his Principal according to the price currant.</p>
               <p>XII. A Factor that hath order to draw upon a third at ſight, does not wiſely if he draw at any time.</p>
               <p>XIII. Above all he ſhould obſerve, not to draw after ſight, but alwayes after date, or at a certain and fixed day.</p>
               <p>XIV. If a Factor hath order to draw on a third at price currant, he muſt follow his Order, though it be to the diſadvantage of his Principal.</p>
               <p>XV. A Principal muſt be content with the courſe his Factor hath concluded on, though it be to his great diſadvantage, whether it proceed from the courſe of Exchange, or from the Factors little credit.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:60840:104"/>
               <p>XVI. Sometimes it falls out, that a Drawer having drawn in a diſadvantagious courſe to the Principal, does for certain Reaſons adviſe his Principal of a better courſe than he got, whereby he loſeth ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs than all his Proviſions; and as this is lawful, ſo alſo it cannot be judged Knavery if the Drawer hath got a very high courſe, if he place his Principal the price currant to account, thereby to make good his loſs; but more not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB,</hi> As this may ſeem diſputeable, ſo alſo doubtleſs its ſtill the beſt way to give the Principal an account of the Remgeltam, and not otherwiſe. For,</p>
               <p>XVII. Such a Factor renders himſelf ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by his Principal, for whoſe account he draws, if he do not adviſe him the true and right courſe wherein he negotiated, as alſo when he makes the Bills in another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Moneys than is uſual and cuſtomary; for by ſo doing he can reckon the courſe afterwards as he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Its very adviſable for Drawers in Commiſſion, that they procure the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of their Draught (eſpecially when on a third Perſon, and not on the Principal directly) without delay.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:60840:105"/>
               <p>XIX. When a Factor hath order to buy Goods, and to draw the Coſts and Charges (or part thereof) on a third Perſon, and he knows not, or doth not much confide in his Principal, then its uſual and cuſtomary for the Factor to correſpond with him on whom he hath order to draw, and know whether he will accept ſuch &amp; ſuch Bills for that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals account, or not; and if he adviſe that he will accept, he is not obliged to accept when the Bills come, <hi>Niſi rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> or that he hath effects in hands.</p>
               <p>XX. He that hath order to draw on one place, and remit to another for the account of a third, or to remit to one place, and draw on another the ſaid value for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a third, he muſt not remit before he know that he can draw, nor draw before he know that he can remit, leſt on the one hand he be in disburſe, on the other, in caſh for his Principal, not knowing how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it, which cannot but diſpleaſe him; and when he hath an opportunity to do both, he muſt before he conclude make his calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether he can with the courſe anſwer the deſigns and limits of his Friend (if he be limitted.)</p>
               <p>XXI. When a Factor hath order to draw
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60840:105"/>a juſt and limitted Sum, then he muſt add to the Sum (if it be to concl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">
                     <desc>…</desc>
                  </gap> an account, &amp;c.) Proviſion, Courtagie, Poſtidge and other Charges.</p>
               <p>XXII. In caſe (according to <hi>Caſe</hi> 19.) the Acceptant in Commiſſion adviſe the Drawer in Commiſſion, that he will accept ſuch and ſuch a Sum for their Principals ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and afterwards the Acceptant, on the preſenting of the Bills for acceptance, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſeth; if the Drawer hath bought and ſhip't Goods, there is no reaſon but the Acceptant ſhould be compelled thereto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Drawer had not bought Goods (or remitted, &amp;c.) but upon the advice of the Acceptant; and ſo he, the Acceptant was the occaſion of the loſs. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIII. But if the Drawer hath not ſhipt the Goods, nor is in any danger of loſing upon that account, then he can demand no more of the Acceptant than Rechange and Charges (ſeeing he gave the occaſion to the loſs) and reparation of his credit, being he ſuffers by having his Bill proteſted. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIV. If a Principal order a Factor to draw, and he having disburſt Moneys for his Principal, doth draw, the Principal may be compelled to accept his Bills, and pay them.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of Remitting in Commiſſion, and ſtanding <hi>Del Credere, i. e.</hi> being Surety therefore.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. HE that remits in Commiſſion, does ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remit for the account of him to whom he remits, or for a third Perſon, and he either ſtands <hi>del Credere,</hi> or not for the Remiſes.</p>
               <p>II. Remitters in Commiſſion muſt take ſpecial care, that they order the Bills to be made payable to whom the Principal gives order; &amp; if he let the Bills be made payable to his own order, he muſt not forget to endorſe them to his Principals order, before he ſend them away.</p>
               <p>III. If a Remitter in Commiſſion hath ordered the Bills to be made payable either directly to the Principal, or to his order, or any other, &amp;c. may (if he think fit) if he hath not ſent the Bills away, or parted with
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60840:106"/>them out of his hands, cauſe them to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and make them payable to any other.</p>
               <p>IV. When a Remitter in Commiſſion hath ſent his Bill to a third Perſon, by the order of his Principal, and in his Letter of advice hath clearly expreſt for whoſe account it is; then neither he nor his Principal can alter or recal the ſame, to the prejudice of him to whom the Remiſes are made.</p>
               <p>In giving of advice, the Remitter muſt obſerve what before was noted in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Chapter.</p>
               <p>V. A Remmitter in Commiſſion, when he remits to one, who lives not in the place where Payment muſt be made, ſhould ſend the <hi>prima</hi> Bill directly to the place of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where Acceptance muſt be demanded, and by Refuſal thereof proteſted; and thus he alſo may have ſpeedy advice himſelf, to ſecure himſelf of the Drawer, from whom he may demand three Bills, and ſend the two other to his Principal.</p>
               <p>VI. When a Bill is thus proteſted for Non-payment, and returned to the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he procures ſatisfaction, with the Rechange, Charges and Proviſions, then the Remitter need not place any more to his Principals Account on the credit, than what
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60840:107"/>for Disburſements it was made Debt; and as for the Proviſion, that is due to the Factor, for procuring of Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>VII. Though a Remitter in Commiſſion ſtands <hi>del Credere</hi> for the Remiſes, yet he doth very unwiſely to order the Bills to be made payable to himſelf or order, and then endorſe them; however, this is frequently practiſed by the chiefeſt Bankers and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, on purpoſe to conceal from the Drawer, to whom they remit; but this is very imprudently done, for theſe Reaſons:
<list>
                     <item>1. The endorſing may be forgotten or neglected, and thence may follow endleſs Diſputes and Conteſts, and great Damage.</item>
                     <item>2. The Remitter by that means makes himſelf lyable not only to anſwer all dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp;c. to the Principal, but alſo to every Poſſeſſor and Endorſer of the Bill after him: For,</item>
                     <item>3. By endorſing the Bill he makes it his own Bill, and obligeth himſelf on the account of his Principal, not only for the Value by him received, but for all other Charges and Re-changes.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. When a Remitter in Commiſſion does not ſtand <hi>del Credere</hi> for the Remiſes, then he doth very imprudently to order the Bills to be made payable to himſelf or order,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60840:107"/>and then endorſe the ſame; for thereby he ſtands effectually <hi>del Credere,</hi> and hath no advantage by it.</p>
               <p>IX. A Remitter in commiſſion that ſtands <hi>del Credere,</hi> may upon the returning of a Bill for Non-acceptance, contracting with the Drawer for the Re-change and Charges, and receiving ſatisfaction, if he hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed the Bill, not only be compelled and required to remit the ſame Value to the ſame place, to fall due at the ſame time, or to give order for the payment of the Sum at the ſame time, but he is alſo obliged to give his Principal the advance of the Re-change, &amp;c. But in caſe he hath endorſed the Bill, he may abſolutely refuſe to give him the advance of the Re-change, and the Principal muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and content with it, becauſe by his Endorſement he made it his own Bill, and he (as well as any other Drawer or Endorſer) may cauſe the Bill to be ſatisfied at the time appointed, and take the advantage of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to himſelf.</p>
               <p>X. A Remitter in Commiſſion, that ſtands <hi>del Credere,</hi> is not obliged, in caſe a Bill be returned with proteſt, and the Drawer is not able to make ſatisfaction, to make good to his Principal any more than the Value he paid for the Bill; the Re-change &amp; Charges,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60840:108"/>if loſt, are loſt to the Principal, becauſe the Remitter had Proviſion for no greater Sum than the Value he paid; but if he get ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Re-change and Charges from the Drawer, then he is obliged to make the ſame good to his Principal; but the Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he receives from he Drawer he may detain for himſelf, and is no way obliged to credit his Principals account for them, unleſs the juſt Sum with the Proviſion and Charges be effectually re-drawn on him, but then he may alſo place his Principal Proviſion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his accepting and paying the ſaid Bill.</p>
               <p>XI. A Remitter in Commiſſion with <hi>del Credere,</hi> is at the returning of a Bill with proteſt for Non-payment, obliged preſently, and without delay to make good the ſaid Value, or to ſuffer it to be drawn on him, becauſe he ſtanding <hi>del Credere,</hi> does oblige himſelf not only for the ſufficiency of the Drawer, but alſo for punctual payment; but then the Intereſt, Rechange, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is all for the profit and advantage of the Remitter himſelf, if the Drawer cannot make preſent punctual payment and ſatisfaction, though he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards will, and gives ſecurity therefore out of his effects, or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>XII. A Remitter in Commiſſion with <hi>del
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60840:108"/>Credere,</hi> giving order for the payment of a Bill proteſted for Non-payment, may charge his Principal with what he pays effectually more than the Bill was for, or what he disburſes more than the value was that he paid, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he let the Principal have leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what loſs he may have, and the charges from the Drawer.</p>
               <p>XIII. A Remitter in Commiſſion with <hi>del Credere,</hi> making the Bills payable to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Principal, or to a third, is obliged (though the ſaid Bill be drawn and endorſed ſeveral times in ſeveral places, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the advice of the Bills being proteſted cannot come in a long time after proteſt is made to his hands) to anſwer to his Principal the value by him paid, and that though the Drawer was for ſome conſiderable time in credit after the advice thereof might have come to his hands, if it had been ſent directly.</p>
               <p>XIV. If any remit in Commiſſion with <hi>del Credere,</hi> in his own Bills, then is he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is alſo Drawer, at the returning of his Bills with proteſt for Non-payment ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to make good to his Principal the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and Charges, as if he had not been the Drawer himſelf, but a Stranger—</p>
               <p>XV. When any remits in Commiſſion
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60840:109"/>with <hi>del Credere,</hi> and makes the Bills for the account of him to whom he remits, then the <hi>Riſco</hi> of ſtanding <hi>del credere</hi> is ended with the day of Payment; ſo that in caſe the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant (ſuppoſe he were alſo the Perſon to whom the Remiſe was made) ſhould fail the very next day after the Bills became due (or within the uſual appointed reſpit dayes a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal proteſt for Non-payment be not entred) the loſs is the Principals, and not the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Commiſſion; but if the Acceptant fail before the day of payment, or does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt himſelf for Non-payment within the dayes of Reſpit, then the loſs is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters, becauſe he alſo is the Drawer of him for whoſe account the Draught was made.</p>
               <p>XVI. When a Remitter in commiſſion hath order from his <hi>principal</hi> to remit to ſome other place (to ſome of his Correſpondents, that he looks on as ſufficient) a certain Sum of Moneys with his <hi>del Credere,</hi> there to wait the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals order; if the ſaid Remitter adviſe his Principal of the Remiſes, and to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the ſaid Sums he duely and truly paid, then the Remitter (if the remitted beyond all fear ſhould fail) is not obliged to the Principal, becauſe the <hi>del Credere</hi> hath only reſpect to the remitting of ſuch Sums in ſufficient Bills, and not to him to whom they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60840:109"/>are remitted, by whom the ſaid Sums from the moment of their being paid to him were at the order and diſpoſal of the Principal, and he having no occaſion inſtantly to diſpoſe of them, he did truſt and credit the ſame in the hands of his Correſpondent.</p>
               <p>XVII. A Factor having order to draw on one place, and to remit to another the ſaid value, or any part thereof, with his <hi>del Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> if it ſhould ſo happen that he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure no ſatisfaction of the value for his Draughts, he muſt ſuffer the loſs, becauſe the <hi>del Credere</hi> in ſuch a caſe hath reſpect to the whole Negotiation, and not to the Remiſes only.</p>
               <p>XVIII. A Factor for an Out-dweller for the ſale of Goods, ſtanding <hi>del Credere</hi> for the Debts, does not ſtand <hi>del Credere</hi> for the Remiſes that he makes to his Principal, iſſuing out of the Debts he hath received, unleſs there be a ſpecial and particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract concerning it.</p>
               <p>XIX. A Remitter in Commiſſion muſt not remit by anticipation in Reſcounter of the advance that is yet for the account of his Principal not come in (or not received) but if he do, he muſt expreſly adviſe him, that the Remiſes are by anticipation, without
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60840:110"/>his prejudice, though the Moneys to ballance this particular in his account be not yet come in.</p>
               <p>XX. And as a Drawer, ſo alſo a Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Commiſſion, with or without <hi>del Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> makes himſelf ſuſpected if he adviſe not his Principal of the true courſe of his Negotiation, as alſo when he makes his Bills (or orders them to be made) or accepts of unendorſed Bills, wherein the Sum that is exchanged is expreſt in a Forreign denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Coyn, and not in that Coyn where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bills of Exchange uſually and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily are made.</p>
               <p>XXI. Becauſe a Remitter in Commiſſion is not obliged to remit, if he can meet with no Bills within the limits of his Commiſſion, and is no wayes obliged to ſupply what is awanting; ſo alſo on the contrary, he is not allowed when the courſe of Exchange is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the limits of his order, to charge his Principals account with a courſe that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but if he with his <hi>del Credere</hi> credit any that have not gained ſufficient credit, or hath loſt part of it, or that is not well known, and can contract with ſuch a one under the courſe (not under the limits) he may then, taking the hazard of the Bill upon himſelf, charge his Principals account, according to the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60840:110"/>courſe of Exchange in the beſt Bills at that time: But if he ſtand not <hi>de Credere,</hi> and his Principal ſhall run the hazard of the Bill, then he doth him wrong if he do not let him have the advantage of the courſe.</p>
               <p>XXII. When any hath a remitted Sum, or any other Effects to remit again, in a juſt and warrantable appointed ſum, and would reckon the Proviſion thereof, he is not allowed to reckon Proviſion of the full advance, that his Principal hath by him, but only of the ſum he is ordered to remit; for otherwiſe he will have Proviſion of his Proviſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>As for Example.</label> When any Factor hath 1000 Pound <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> to remit with his <hi>del credere,</hi> then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>per Cent.</hi> Proviſion is reckoned, which makes 40 <hi>Guilders,</hi> and one <hi>per Mille</hi> Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagie is 6 <hi>Guilders,</hi> and 5954 <hi>Guilders</hi> remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is in all 6000 <hi>Guilders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in regard the Courtagie of the ſum Remitted is only <hi>Guilders</hi> 5. 19 <hi>Gr.</hi> at one <hi>per Mille,</hi> ſo alſo the Proviſion is no more then <hi>Ggl.</hi> 39.14. which make toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ggl.</hi> 45.13. ſo that there is 7 <hi>Gr.</hi> or <hi>St.</hi> difference, that the Factor reckons too much in his own Favour.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:60840:111"/>
               <p>XXIII. If the Bills of a Remitter, upon his own <hi>del credere,</hi> be returned with Proteſt and he can procure no ſatisfaction preſently of the Drawer, though he get Security, yet if he be forced to disburſe his own, or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Monyes of another at Intereſt, he may place the ſame to the Drawers account, and make him allow the ſame. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIV. He that remits in Commiſſion, and is negligent and careleſs, dealing with thoſe that are ſuſpected to be Inſolvent, or near failing, muſt bear the loſs and run the hazard, as if he effectually ſtood <hi>del credere. Sigiſm. Scaccia.</hi> fol. 411. and 391. Num. 400. <hi>&amp; ſequentibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXV. He that makes a Remiſe for the Poſſeſſors account, cannot revoke his Order, with the conſent of the Drawer, nor forbid the Payment, but if for his own account, he may. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>

He that is drawn on, either for the account of a third, or for the Drawers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, making a difficulty either freely or <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt to accept for the one or the others account, may accept the ſame in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of any one Endorſer <hi>ſupra</hi> proteſt, if he know &amp; dare truſt any one of them, and then he is obliged to give the Drawer, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for whoſe account it is, and alſo the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer for whoſe account he accepts, advice thereof, and to ſend the Proteſt and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt in honour of any Endorſer to the ſaid Endorſer, for his uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Drawer.</p>
               <p>VI. When the Acceptant hath accepted a Bill <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> in honour of the Drawer or any Endorſer for want of advice or order, or
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60840:112"/>Proviſion from him for whoſe account the Bill is drawn, and he ſhall atterwards receive Orders and Proviſion, then he is obliged to free the Drawer and Endorſer from their Obligations, and to adviſe them that he will pay the Draught for his account for whoſe it was drawn, and that he therefore diſchargeth them.</p>
               <p>VII. When an Acceptant accepts a Bill with the Drawers Obligation, then he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged at the day of payment to adviſe the Drawer, whether he for whoſe account the Bill was drawn did make Proviſion for it, or other wayes give ſufficient order for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, and that he therefore diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him from his Obligation.</p>
               <p>VIII. When any is drawn on for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a third by one with whom the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant never had any Correſpondency, and therefore knows not his Hand-writing, then muſt great prudence be uſed, though the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant hath order from the Principal to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſame, and muſt in no wiſe accept of any ſuch Bill without a Letter of advice from the Drawer himſelf, that the Hand-writing in the Bill and Letter may be compared.</p>
               <p>IX. He that verbally or by Letter hath promiſed to accept of any Bills drawn on him
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60840:113"/>for the account of a third, he to whom this promiſe was made relying thereon, gives the third Perſon credit, then he that made the promiſe is obliged to perform it, in reſpect of him to whom he made the promiſe; but if he afterwards refuſe to accept his Bill for the account of the ſaid third Perſon, the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of the Bill cannot force him thereto by preſent execution, but only in the ordinary legal way.</p>
               <p>X. No Acceptant can or muſt accept for his Principal Bills drawn by another for his account, unleſs he hath expreſs order ſo to do, and the Drawer doth in every reſpect fully and punctually obſerve his order, if the thrid Perſon, for whoſe account was drawn, adviſe the Acceptant thereof.</p>
               <p>XI. When a Factor hath order from his Principal to accept a certain Sum from a third, for his account at uſance, and the third draws at ſight becauſe he could not meet with any opportunity according to his Principals order to draw at uſance; in ſuch a caſe the Acceptant may accept the Dranght in honour of the Drawer <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt, and re-value the ſame upon him, if he hath no order from the Principal how he may be re-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:60840:113"/>
               <p>XII. When a Factor hath order from his Principal to accept of any Draughts at uſance from a third, and the third finds no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to draw the ſame till half uſance be expired, and then draws at half uſance, in ſuch a caſe the Acceptant is obliged to accept freely and willingly.</p>
               <p>XIII. If any be drawn on in Commiſſion, and is ordered to draw the value again from ſome place elſe, whence he probably can meet with no Moneys, or cannot draw in the limitted courſe, and finds it is not his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to disburſe ſo much Moneys for his Principals account, then he may, if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do otherwiſe, charge his Bills directly on the Drawer, or any other place, even above the limitted courſe, at the beſt courſe for his Principal that he can procure.</p>
               <p>XIV. If any be drawn on in Commiſſion, and he hath accepted the Bill, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not demanded at the day, then he muſt and may debit the Principal for the ſaid Value, as if it were paid, becauſe he is ſtill obliged for the Sum, at all times, and in all places.</p>
               <p>XV. The Acceptant of a Bill in Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, drawn at time on him, may and muſt,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60840:114"/>if the Drawer againſt the time of payment do again call in the Bill himſelf, and pay the Moneys, demand of him his accepted Bill, and the Drawer is obliged to reſtore it; but he muſt before he part with it clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and write upon it, that he himſelf called in the Bill and ſatisfied it, and tear or cut it through with a Knife for a token of its being made void, and the Drawer is obliged at leaſt to allow the Acceptant half Proviſion.</p>
               <p>XVI. When a Factor is drawn upon to ſatisfie the Bill out of the Effects or Goods that he hath in his hands to diſpoſe of, then he is alwayes, whatever happen, preferred to thoſe Goods, and muſt have his Disburſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of them before any other Creditors can lay any claim thereto.</p>
               <p>XVII. If any be drawn upon in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and there afterwards be found any difference in their Accounts, as the Sums and Quantities drawn, the Acceptant is obliged to prove his account by producing the Bills, no other Evidence (for many Reaſons) being Proof ſufficient. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. ITs the Duty of him to whom a Bill is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<list>
                     <item>1. To endeavour to procure acceptance.</item>
                     <item>2. On refuſal to proteſt, if not forbidden, though not expreſly ordered.</item>
                     <item>3. To adviſe the Remitter of the Receit, Acceptance or Proteſting thereof, and to ſend the Proteſt to him. And,</item>
                     <item>4. To adviſe any other third Perſon that is or may be concerned in it; and all this without delay by the return of the next Poſt.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>II. He that hath Bills remitted to him for the account of a third, or to be at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of a third, cannot place the ſaid Bills either to his own or to the Remitters account, nor to any others account, but he is obliged to obſerve the order of him only for whoſe account, and at whoſe diſpoſal the ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and Bills was ordered and remitted to him.</p>
               <p>III. If a Bill remitted for the account, or
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60840:115"/>to be at the diſpoſal of a third, be endorſed or made payable at firſt to the Receiver thereof, or to his order, he that receives the Bill cannot, if he hath adviſed the Perſon for whoſe account, or at whoſe diſpoſal it muſt be, that he hath received ſuch a Bill for his account, or to be at his diſpoſal, revoke his Word to pleaſure the Remitter, but muſt wait for the order of the ſaid third Perſon; but if he hath not writ nor adviſed the ſaid third Perſon thereof, then he may, at the requeſt of the Remitter (or the Remitter at the requeſt of the Poſſeſſor) obſerve the laſt order, or wait for further orders.</p>
               <p>IV. When any have Moneys remitted to them in Commiſſion, and the Principal orders the ſame Moneys to be remitted fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſome other place, or otherwiſe to diſpoſe thereof, if the ſaid Perſon to whom the Moneys was remitted do omit this order, or neglect it, and detains the Moneys by him, the ſame is obliged to make good to his Principal all the loſs and damage he can thereby pretend by the not obſerving his Order and effecting his Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>V. If any have Bills remitted to them, to be endorſed and drawn in from other places, and the Principal either limits the courſe at which he would have them re-valued, or
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60840:115"/>orders them to be ſent back; if he cannot negotiate them at the limited courſe for want of Moneys, or Reſcounter, or Credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he does then very unwiſely if he ſend the ſaid Bills back in <hi>blanco,</hi> or endorſed, payable to the order of his Principal, becauſe if the Bills were returned with Proteſt he would make himſelf lyable to anſwer for them; but to free himſelf of the fear of this trouble and loſs, if the Bills be made payable or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed to the order of his Principal, and the Principal endorſes them payable to his order, (i. e. the Factors) he may ſcrape or blot out that order, and make it illegible, and ſo ſend the Bills back again. But then again, if the Bills be originally made payable to the order of him to whom they are remitted, the value of the Remitter, and this can no wayes be altered, then its adviſable for him to write on the back of the Bill, that the contents and value was not paid to his order, but to a later order of the Remitters, is yet to be paid.</p>
               <p>VI. When any receives a Remiſe for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of another, and the Bill is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or accepted is not paid at the due time, but proteſted, then the Perſon to whom was remitted, if he hath occaſion for Moneys for the Principals account, he may value the Sum on the Remitter (when he returns the Proteſt and Bills) together with Courtagie,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60840:116"/>Proviſion and Charges for the Principals ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, giving the perſon he draws on punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al advice.</p>
               <p>VII. When any hath Moneys remitted to him in divers Bills, for divers accounts, for one more, for another leſs, and rekoning the Sum total of all the Bills, and not advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any, which Bills were for this, and which for that, and which for a thirds account, in caſe then one of the Remiſes ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted for Non-payment, then the Poſſeſſor thereof may at his beſt conveniency re-value the ſame on the Remitter, and if he cannot get ſatisfaction there, then the loſs will fall upon all the Bills, for whoſe account the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were, and every one muſt bear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the loſs, <hi>pro Rato,</hi> of the Sum he was to have in thoſe Remiſes, and if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter ſtood <hi>del Credere</hi> for any, he muſt ſuffer loſs, <hi>pro Rato,</hi> with the reſt.</p>
               <p>VIII. If any have Remiſes made for Draughts that were formerly drawn on him, and fall due before the Remiſes do, and ſo come too late to do the Acceptant any ſervice in order to the ſatisfying of thoſe Draughts, then he may, if he pleaſe, reckon Intereſt for the disburſe of his own Moneys for the time, at 6 <hi>per Centum per Annum,</hi> and for what is more than fourteen dayes, a full Moneth
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60840:116"/>may be reckoned, and half a Moneth for what the time is leſs than fourteen dayes; but if it be not his conveniency to disburſe his Moneys for the time, he may againſt the time the Draught falls due value the Sum on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, and keep the product of his Remiſes till his further order: But thus to do will give little ſatisfaction or content to the firſt Drawer, and will not be much for the credit of the other.</p>
               <p>IX. A Factor that is remitted to, and then drawn upon, is not very wiſe, or elſe he is eaſily ſatisfied, and would gladly work for nothing that will be content with one Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>per cent.</hi> Proviſion, eſpecially if he,
<list>
                     <item>1. Muſt bear the Charges of Poſtidge, and dare not place them to the Principal's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</item>
                     <item>2. Or if the Bills muſt both or either of them be paid in currant Moneys, without the Bank. Or,</item>
                     <item>3. If the Draughts come ſooner than the Remiſes, and ſo by Conſequence he muſt nakedly credit his Principal. Or,</item>
                     <item>4. If the Draughts fall due, though but one day ſooner than the Remiſes, and he muſt pay the Draughts before the Remiſes be received.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>X. If a Poſſeſſor in Commiſſion proteſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60840:117"/>not in due Time and Form, either for Non-acceptance or Non-payment, he himſelf is lyable to make good to the Remitter, or him for whoſe account it was, the Rechange and Charges, though the Acceptant is obliged for no more than the Sum that the Bill is for, and the Drawer, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> diſcharged. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Of Rechange, and Continuance of Exchange and Rechange.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. REchange in its largeſt Acceptation, is the Value of a drawn or remitted Sum, Redrawn or Remitted by the Payer, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Value, either to, or on the Place directly from which was drawn or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or to, or on any other Place or Fair.</p>
               <p>II. But in a ſtricter Senſe, its taken for the Revaluing or Remitting directly, on or to the firſt Drawer or Remitter.</p>
               <p>III. A true and proper Rechange muſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60840:117"/>alſo exactly anſwer the Value of the juſt Sum of that Bill, whereof it is the Rechange.</p>
               <p>IV. When any Revalues or Redraws in the aforeſaid manner, to the juſt Sum and Value that he paid, he muſt add Proviſion, Courtagie, Poſtidge, Proteſt, &amp;c. and all other Charges that are uſually reckoned; and this ſum added together, is the juſt ſum to be Revalued.</p>
               <p>V. In Revaluing, the Proviſion muſt be reckoned for the ſum that is firſt drawn, Courtagie for the Sum revalued or redrawn.</p>
               <p>VI. In Remitting of the juſt Sum, both the Proviſion and Courtagie muſt be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the Sum remitted.</p>
               <p>VII. When a Factor Remits, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>values the juſt Sum of the Remiſes, and drawn a certain Sum, and remits the value to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, then he muſt reckon his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſum he remits, and not of the ſum that he draws, and Courtagie for both.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Redrawing need not be delayed till after the Draughts are diſcharged, but may freely and without fear of a Reproof be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn the Poſt day before thoſe Draughts fall due; for a Factor is not obliged, nor is it always
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60840:118"/>his conveniency, to disburſe his Moneys, though but for a few dayes.</p>
               <p>IX. Neither is it neceſſary, or can it be required of a Factor to Remit, before the Remiſes be received; and if it be done ſooner to pleaſure the firſt Remittent, it muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be done under Proteſt, to ſuffer no damage.</p>
               <p>X. When a Factor hath the advance of the Remiſes to Remit, he muſt ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Order of his Principal, and may, if he cannot come within his limits, delay the remitting, and let the advance lie by him undiſpoſed of, till the Principals fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order.</p>
               <p>XI. When a Factor hath occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw for the Principals account, for draughts firſt drawn on him, he is not ſo preciſely bound to the Order of his Principal, but can, and may (if he neither will, nor can be in disburſe) redraw, not only according to Order, and within his Limits; but he may exceed the Order and Limits ſet him; and if he hath no Order, may redraw without Order, yea, and expreſly againſt Order if need be.</p>
               <p>XII. Factors in redrawing, follow their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60840:118"/>Orders, and obſerve their Limits, when the Debtor for the accepted Bill (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, for whoſe account it was drawn, or for whoſe account the ſame was accepted <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi>) having ordered and limitted the Acceptant, or him that is to diſcharge the Bill and Draught for his account, how, and when he may revalue, if the Factor do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or to more and better advantage than the Principals orders or limits were; in this caſe the Principal hath nothing to ſay.</p>
               <p>XIII. But its above order and limits, when thus the Factor re-draws on that place and perſon, that his Principal orders, but in a more diſadvantagious courſe than he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and the Principal in this caſe muſt be ſilent and patient, though it be to his loſs.</p>
               <p>XIV. And its without order when the Principal and Debtor for the Bill did not or could not make Proviſion for the diſcharge of the Bill, and therefore gave no order how the Acceptant ſhould be re-imburſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Factor draws on him, becauſe he cannot be in disburſe, or will not, thinking it unadviſable.</p>
               <p>XV. And its againſt order when the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal hath ordered that the Factor ſhall draw
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60840:119"/>on another place, or at long time; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Factor either could not or would not draw on ſuch a place and perſon, nor at ſo long time, he therefore draws directly on his Principal at ſight, or at ſhorter time than he ordered, or redraws on ſome other place or perſon, where he can.</p>
               <p>XVI. When an Acceptant of a Bill will revalue without or againſt order, then its moſt adviſable and beſt anſwerable, that he draw directly upon the Debtor and Principal, rather than on any elſe.</p>
               <p>XVII. He that is Debtor for a Bill, is and remains ſtill (in reſpect of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer) Debtor for the Re-change that his Factor draws on him for the diſcount of his Draughts, and this whether he draw di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly on the Principal, or on any other third Perſon for the Principals account.</p>
               <p>XVIII. When any is drawn upon for the account of a third perſon, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant accepts <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> for the account of the Drawer, and does adviſe him expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereof at the return of the Poſt, then the Acceptant may (if he get not ſufficient Proviſion from the Principal, or elſe ſufficient orders for his Re-imburſement before the Draughts fall due) revalue upon the Drawer,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60840:119"/>and is not obliged to ſeek his Redreſs firſt on any third perſon, for whoſe account the Draught was. But if the Acceptance was made <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> with the obligation of the Drawer, then the Acceptant muſt, if the Drawer require it, firſt ſeek his redreſs on a third perſon, for whoſe account it was drawn; and yet he is no further obliged in this caſe than to revalue on the third perſon; and if his Bill be proteſted, or not accepted; nor paid, then he hath his regreſs upon the Drawer, whoſe obligation he reſerved to the laſt.</p>
               <p>XIX. When Proviſion for a Bill, drawn for the account of a third, by the Acceptant accepted <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> with the obligation of the Drawer, is not made by him for whoſe account it is drawn againſt the time that it falls due, but orders are only given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the ſame directly upon himſelf, or on ſome other place, then the Acceptant muſt in this caſe firſt conſult the Drawer, who hath obliged himſelf, before he can revalue the ſame, and adviſe him, that this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he will yet remain by his obligation till the Sum to be re-valued be re-paid.</p>
               <p>XX. When the Acceptant of a Bill drawn for the account of a third, but accepted <hi>ſupra Protest</hi> for the account of the Drawer, with
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60840:120"/>the Drawers obligation, &amp;c. doth re-value on a third perſon at the requeſt of the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the ſaid Acceptants Bills are either not accepted, or if accepted, not paid in due time, and ſo are ſent back with Proteſt, then he that diſcharged the firſt draughts, and muſt alſo diſcharge the proteſted Bills, may re-value the ſaid Sum, with the Charges, Proviſions and Proteſt on the firſt Drawer, by whoſe obligation he ſtill remained.</p>
               <p>XXI. When a Bill is <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> for the account, or with the obligation of the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er accepted, and the Acceptant afterwards repents, and is jealous whether the Drawer will really accept of his Re-draughts, then its beſt that the Acceptant ſuffer the Bills to return proteſted for Non-payment; but firſt adviſe him, that he may take new orders for the diſcharge of his Bills.</p>
               <p>XXII. If any be drawn upon for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a third, and the Bill be freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for the account of that third, ſuch a one at the day of payment hath no regreſs on the Drawer, and the Drawer is not obliged, if the Acceptant re-draw, to accept of his Bills, becauſe the Acceptant by his free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance hath diſcharged the Drawer, and is obliged to look for his re-imburſment
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60840:120"/>from the third Perſon, for whoſe account he accepted.</p>
               <p>XXIII. But in caſe the Principal in any of the 11, 13, 14 or 15 <hi>Caſes</hi> fore-going, will not accept the Bills of the Acceptant redrawn upon him, becauſe they are without, above or againſt order, what ſhall the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant then do? ſeeing without acceptance there is no obligation on any to pay a Bill of Exchange, and the Acceptant was not ſo wiſe as to cauſe or ſuffer the Bills to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, by which means he could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Drawer to dance to his Pipe. My Authors, that I remember, have none of them ſalved this caſe; and though it would ſeem to be very reaſonable and equitable, that the Principal ſhould, according to the Laws of Exchanges, be proceeded againſt, <hi>Executive;</hi> yet I cannot ſee that there is any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for ſuch Factors, but the ordinary one, and to proceed againſt their Principals A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Mandati. Sigiſm. Scaccia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIV. <hi>Scaccia.</hi> If Bills be proteſted for Non-payment, Re-change is due but once, though the Remitter or the Poſſeſſor can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nothing of the Drawer or Acceptant at that inſtant, and afterwards only Intereſt, till a contract or compoſition be agreed upon; otherwiſe, if Re-change and Intereſt upon
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60840:121"/>Intereſt ſhould be due in <hi>Infinitum,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt would ſoon exceed the Principal, and it would be impoſſible for the poor Debtor to recover, nor is it once due if the Monyes afterwards be paid in the place of payment in due time.</p>
               <p>XXV. <hi>Scaccia. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſura Poenae</hi> is ſeldom or never due (as, if you pay not ſo much at ſuch a time, you ſhall forfeit ſo much more) for if Intereſt upon Intereſt be unlawful, much more this; for that Intereſt that doth by ſuperfactation, as it were, produce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intereſt, can produce no more than in proportion to the Capital; but this is uſually much more, and is only added to ſcare the Debtor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. BY <hi>Fairs</hi> is meant <hi>free</hi> and <hi>priviledged anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Fairs,</hi> which are held at certain places and times, ſometimes twice, thrice, and oftner in one year, to which all Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60840:121"/>and Forreign Merchants are admitted to come and Trade, and for that time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſuch Priviledges and Immunities as the Magiſtrates have allowed and granted.</p>
               <p>II. The moſt renowned and famous <hi>Marts</hi> or <hi>Fairs</hi> in theſe times in our parts, are <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> on the main, <hi>Leipzig</hi> in <hi>Suchſen</hi> (or <hi>Saxonia</hi>) <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France, Modena</hi> in <hi>Italy, Beſonſon</hi> (or <hi>Biſenzon</hi>) in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Bolzane</hi> in <hi>Tyrol;</hi> but at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> there is found no courſe of Exchange but to the three firſt, as <hi>Frankford, Leipzig</hi> and <hi>Lyons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. At <hi>Frankford</hi> are yearly two, at <hi>Leipzig</hi> three, and at <hi>Lyons</hi> four Fairs.</p>
               <p>IV. And ſo ſoon (and ſometimes before) as one Fair is ended at one place, Exchanges are made on the ſame place for the next Fair; but its ſeldom that any Exchanges are made payable at the ſecond or third Fair en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the date of the Bill; yet on theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions Bills may be made and negotiated, and ſuch Exchanges are as obligatory as any other, if the preciſe time of payment be clearly expreſt in the Bills (though ſome are of another Opinion) and the Drawer is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged at the time to perform the contract agreed on, the courſe, &amp;c. may be as it will.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:60840:122"/>
               <p>V. In the reſpective Fairs Exchanges are made not only on other Forreign places, but alſo on the ſame place where the Fair is kept, and that not only between the Fair times for the next Fair, but alſo for the enſuing Fairs in the Fair time.</p>
               <p>VI. When a man draws ſimply on ſuch a Fair in ſuch a place, then its to be underſtood of the firſt Fair next enſuing in that place, and the payment muſt be made at the uſual time of payment in that place and Fair.</p>
               <p>VII. Its uſual and cuſtomary, when Bills are made on a Fair that is not yet begun, that then the time of payment is expreſt thus, <hi>At the next enſuing Fair, &amp;c.</hi> but if the Fair be already begun, then they expreſs it thus, <hi>At the preſent</hi> Eaſter <hi>Fair,</hi> Michaelmaſs <hi>Fair,</hi> Auguſt <hi>Fair, &amp;c.</hi> as the Name of that Fair may be.</p>
               <p>VIII. In Exchanging on Fairs, the Drawer is not obliged to furniſh the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Bills ſooner than about ſo long a time before the beginning of the Fair, that they being ſent <hi>per</hi> Poſt thither, can be there before the Fair begin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB,</hi> This is the cuſtom in the <hi>Frankford</hi> Fairs at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but in the Fairs of <hi>Lyons</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:60840:122"/>and <hi>Leipzig</hi> the Drawer muſt inſtantly give his Bill; and though ſome Merchants have endeavoured to introduce this order and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in the Exchanges on <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Leipzig,</hi> yet it could take no effect, though it would tend greatly to the advantage of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to have Moneys in their diſpoſal for a little time, to the leſſening of much Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that is now paid to the <hi>Lyoners</hi> and <hi>Leipzigers,</hi> and to the advantage of the Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
               <p>IX. If the Drawer do not preſently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Bills to the Remitter, then he ought, as ſoon as he receives the Value, give under his Hand and Seal a Writing, ſpecifying the Contract, and obliging himſelf to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, and to deliver the Poſſeſſor Bills for the value, againſt the beginning of the Fair.</p>
               <p>X. He that remits to a Fair, muſt demand the Bills ſo timouſly that he can ſend them away to be there before the beginning of the Fair, or at furtheſt, within the uſual time of Acceptance; for by the late arrival of Bills, ſometimes in the times of Payment great diſorders and confuſions do happen.</p>
               <p>XI. The Acceptance of Bills payable in Fairs, ought not to be done but in the Fairs,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60840:123"/>nor need the Acceptant declare whether he will accept or no, before the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but the Fair being begun, the deſigned Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant muſt declare, within a certain fixed preciſe time, whether he will accept or no, or elſe the Poſſeſſor muſt proteſt for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance.</p>
               <p>XII. If Acceptance be made before the beginning of the Fair, and the Bill be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then the Aeceptance is Obligatory, though it be againſt the Order, Stile and Cuſtom of the Fair, nor can the Acceptant repent, (but too late) nor any way be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p>XIII. The diſcharging and paying of Bills in the Fairs, is for the moſt part done by verbal Reſconters, whereof thoſe that make Reſconters do afterwards make and keep exact and perfect Notes: In ſome Fairs they uſe only to note the Reſconter in their Day-Books, or Memorial, or Pocket-Books, that can be blotted out again: But in other Fairs the Reſconters muſt be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſt on Paper, written with Ink, in Books for that purpoſe, called Reſconter-Books, that in caſe of any Diſpute or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, all Frauds may be prevented; and when the Reſconter is once made, its as effectual as if the Bill were paid with ready Caſh.</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:60840:123"/>
               <p>XIV. If any Payments cannot be made exactly by Reſconter for the juſt Sum, then on the laſt day of the Pay-Week, if the time will not permit to tell the Sum that day in Specie, they give and take from one another (after they have adjuſted the Sum) a Note for the Value that one or the other muſt pay, and then they can receive it the Week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>XV. When on the laſt day of the Pay-Week, (or of payment) the Acceptant does not diſcharge the Bill, neither by Caſh nor by Reſconter, then the Poſſeſſor is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to proteſt, or elſe he loſes his regreſs on the Drawer.</p>
               <p>XVI. In all Fairs there are but few, at moſt, and in ſome but one Notary Publick allowed of, who is to proteſt, and muſt keep a Protocal of every Proteſt, to which every one muſt have free acceſs to ſee and know what Bills for Non acceptance, and what Bills for Non-payment are proteſted, that they may, if they pleaſe, in honour of the Drawer or Endorſer, accept and pay them.</p>
               <p>XVII. All Fairs have alſo their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judges, <hi>(pre Tempore)</hi> which uſually are
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60840:124"/>choſen out of the Merchants that frequent the Fair, and are uſually three in Number, one Conſul and two Counſellors, who after hearing of the partys, do decide all Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Diſputes among them; no Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers nor Advocates being admitted to plead, and their Sentence is definitive, and muſt be executed, unleſs the party that is grieved do appeal to the higheſt Court of Judicature that is in the place where the fair is kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB,</hi> This laudable Cuſtom is in other places obferved, appointing a Colledge of Commerce to hear and determin of all Controverſies, either in Merchandizing or in Exchanges among Merchants, where the Proceſs is ſhort, and without delay; and every one is himſelf (ſome caſes excepted, becauſe of the Infirmities of the partys) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to propound and plead his own Cauſe, and to urge their Reaſons, and exhibit their Evidence, and without any other Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Proceſs ſentence is ſpoken, from whence an Appeal lies to the higheſt Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in that place, only and ſurely this (as alſo a Court for the determining of Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about Sea-affairs) is very neceſſary and uſefull in all places of Commerce, and very advantagious to the Trade of any place: Nor can I ſee any Reaſon, but both theſe may very well be under the authority of one Judicature, if every City of Trade would
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60840:124"/>take ſuch meaſures as theſe, queſtionleſs they would tend much, 1. To maintain the Credit and Honour of honeſt Merchants: 2. To the diſcovery of many Frauds: 3. To prevent great loſs by tedious and chargeable Proceſſes: 4. To the promoting of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Trade: And 5thly, To the Credit, Repute and Fame of the City it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB,</hi> Every Trader to theſe particular Fairs, will know the Ordinances and Laws concerning Exchanges there made, ſo that it will not be neceſſary to be large upon theſe; therefore what the Author hath large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſted on, in the three following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I ſhall abridge, and only hint to ſome ſelect Caſes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> Of Exchanges from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Frankford</hi> on the Main, <hi>&amp; Vice Verſa.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. AT <hi>Amſterdam</hi> a Remitter can diſpoſe of his Monyes to any place (<hi>Venice</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) upon time, in Exchange, making the Bills payable to his Order, and draw the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60840:125"/>ſame in again, without having any Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent there, at the place where the Bill is payable, or allowing any Proviſion at all; and on the contrary, a Drawer on <hi>Frankford</hi> at the Fair time, can draw on <hi>Frankford,</hi> and can ſupply, Adjuſt, Reſconter or Prolonge, without having any Correſpondent or Factor there.</p>
               <p>II. Becauſe by an old Cuſtom, Bills need not be accepted that are drawn on <hi>Frankford's</hi> Fair, till the beginning of the Fair, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bill is payable; therefore its not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to make Bills till againſt that time, unleſs it be otherwiſe conditioned.</p>
               <p>III. Wherefore it were neceſſary, that the Drawer ſhould give a Bill or Obligation in the interim; for the furniſhing of Bills on ſuch terms as are agreed on.</p>
               <p>IV. When the Drawer on the Fair, does remit with his Remitter to the ſaid Fair, the Sum, which he before drew, then that parcel doth mortifie it ſelf; if he remit with another, then he can aſſign his Remitter on his Drawer; ſo alſo when a Remitter does redraw the ſum he remitted, then he obliges himſelf to his Remitter to furniſh him with Bills, which when he demands, he aſſigns him on his Drawer.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:60840:125"/>
               <p>V. He that muſt have Bills to ſend to the <hi>Frankford's</hi> Fair, muſt take ſpecial notice that it be clearly expreſt and named, <hi>By Whom, and On Whom, To Whom, and From Whom the Value is aſſigned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. The Aſſignations on the <hi>Frankford's</hi> Fair, are of the ſame Virtue and Power that Endorſments on a Bill are.</p>
               <p>VII. And the Poſſeſſor of a <hi>Frankford's</hi> Fair Bill, that proteſt for Non-payment, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not only have his Regreſs by the firſt Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but on any of the Aſſigners, as if they had been Endorſers, and hath over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this Priviledge, that he may chuſe which of the Aſſigners he pleaſes, to demand Satisfaction of, being not bound to his man.</p>
               <p>VIII. A prudent and circumſpect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter on the <hi>Frankford's</hi> Fairs, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his Drawer any Bills to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Sum that the Remitter hath furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they be made by a third, and made ſimply payable to his Remitter, or his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the value from the firſt Remitters Drawer, becauſe for ſuch Bills the firſt Drawer is not lyable to anſwer to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter; but on the contrary, the Remitter is made anſwerable to the Drawer, but the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60840:126"/>Bills muſt be made payable to the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter or his Order, the value of the ſame from the Drawer.</p>
               <p>IX. On <hi>Frankford's</hi> (and at no other) Fair, men may treat and condition for the payment of the Bill at the return from the Fair, that is, inſtead of delivering Bills (or negotiating them at <hi>Frankford</hi> in the Fair time, or diſcharging them on the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to pay the ſame at the return (or ſooner or later, as the condition is, at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fixed day) at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time the courſe of Exchange is proportioned.</p>
               <p>X. The uſual times of payment at return are, for the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Fair <hi>ultimo Junji,</hi> for the <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> Fair <hi>ultimo Novembris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. If at any time the Term be prolonged till the return, then the Drawer ought to cauſe the conditions to be noted on the back of that Obligation he gave to his Remitter, whereby he obligeth himſelf to deliver Bills, or make payment at the Fair, or elſe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie or vacate the old, and make a new Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>XII. A Merchant that hath credit at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> for the <hi>Frankford's</hi> Fair, can at any
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60840:126"/>time, for ſo ſhort and ſo long a time, as he pleaſeth; draw upon the Fairs, and make uſe of the Monyes as he ſees occaſion, and can at any time before the beginning of the Fair remit the ſame thither, in order to make payment, or he can prolong it till the return, or vacate the former Bills, and make new ones on the next Fair, which Negotiation will be of no more loſs to him than ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſual Intereſt is, ſeeing he hath no Proviſions to pay, and only Courtagie for the Mackelers, and is far more honourable and profitable for the Drawer than any other kind of Negotiation where Factors muſt be uſed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>XIII. If any fail in their punctual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either at the Fairs, or their returns, or in delivering Bills according to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it be ſufficiently manifeſt, then againſt ſuch a one (if there be ſuch an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation) there is the ſame Law, as if there were proteſted Bills of Exchange, <hi>viz.</hi> ready execution, with attachment upon his Goods, and arreſt upon his Perſon, and in caſe of failing the Re-change is alſo due, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>XIV. At <hi>Frankford</hi> are two Fairs yearly, the <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>September</hi> Fair, the one begins fourteen days before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the other on the <hi>Sunday</hi> that is before or after, or on the day
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60840:127"/>of the birth of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> if this day fall on a <hi>Monday, Tueſday</hi> or <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> then the <hi>Sunday</hi> before; if on a <hi>Thurſday,</hi> &amp;c. then after, if on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> then on that ſame day; they each continue fourteen dayes, the firſt Week is called, <hi>The Acceptance Week,</hi> the latter, <hi>The Payment Week;</hi> the times of Acceptance continues from <hi>Mondayes</hi> in the Morning till <hi>Tueſdayes</hi> at nine a Clock in the the Morning, but may be accepted any time that Week, and ſo long the Poſſeſſor is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſtay; but if acceptance be not made that Week, in the next Week, he may and muſt proteſt, though he may proteſt ſooner if he pleaſe, if the acceptance be abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed: All Acceptances here muſt now be written; verbal Acceptances are not valid.</p>
               <p>XV. If an accepted Bill be not paid on <hi>Saturday</hi> in the <hi>Pay Week</hi> before the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change time, or at Exchange time, then the Poſſeſſor ought to proteſt for Non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the Sun ſet.</p>

                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. <hi>LEipzig</hi> hath three Fairs yearly, the <hi>New Years,</hi> the <hi>Jubilate,</hi> and the <hi>Michaelmaſs Fair;</hi> on which dayes, or the dayes after, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Old Stile,</hi> the ſaid Fairs begin; they continue but eight dayes wherein they trade, and buy, and ſell; the firſt or ſecond dayes after the Fairs are begun, acceptance is demanded, but if the Acceptant will, he may delay acceptance till the <hi>Pay Week</hi> after the Fair, which continues five dayes after the expiration of the aforeſaid eight dayes.</p>
               <p>II. The Poſſeſſor may if he will proteſt ſooner, but he muſt not ſend the Bill away till the Fair be wholly concluded, but muſt wait to ſee if any appear to honour the Bill <hi>ſupra Proteſt;</hi> no Proteſts are admitted of after ten a Clock at Night on the laſt day of the Fair, and if the Poſſeſſor proteſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, he loſeth his hold that he had of the Drawer; if none appear to make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a proteſted Bill within three dayes
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60840:128"/>after the Fair is fully expired, then may the Poſſeſſor with the firſt Poſt return the Bill with the Proteſt.</p>
               <p>III. For Exchanges made at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> on <hi>Leipzig,</hi> Bills muſt inſtantly be given, but the Acceptant need not accept or declare whether he will or no till the Fair time; here alſo Bills that are endorſed are admitted of.</p>
               <p>IV.

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. AT <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France</hi> are year four Fairs, the <hi>Royal Fair,</hi> which begins the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> after <hi>Epiphany</hi> or <hi>Three Kings day;</hi> the <hi>Eaſter Fair,</hi> which begins on St <hi>Niſiers</hi> day in <hi>April;</hi> the <hi>August Fair,</hi> which begins on St <hi>Dominicks</hi> day in <hi>August;</hi> the St <hi>Huverts Fair,</hi> which begins on that day in <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Every Fair hath its Payments; the <hi>Fair Royal</hi> hath its time of Payments from the firſt to the laſt of <hi>March;</hi> the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments begin the firſt and end the laſt of <hi>July;</hi> the <hi>August</hi> Payments begin the firſt and end the laſt of <hi>September;</hi> and the St <hi>Huverts</hi> Payments begin the firſt and end the laſt of <hi>December.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. At <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Bills are made pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the enſuing or preſent Payment; but its not uſual before one Payment hath begun to negotiate on a following, but on a ſecond or third Payment.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:60840:129"/>
               <p>IV. Bills for Parcels, negotiated on <hi>Lyons,</hi> muſt inſtantly be given, and that before the Remitter pay the Value; but Bills made payable at the Fair, are not payable till the payment of that Fair whereof they are made payable, nor need they be accepted till the beginning of the times of Payment, and may be deferred till the ſixth day after the beginning of the reſpective payments, but no longer, within which time Proteſt muſt be made: All Acceptances muſt be made in writing.</p>
               <p>V. None can by a full Power negotiate or accept any Bills, unleſs he firſt ſhow his full Power to the Judges of the Fair, and cauſe it to be regiſtred, which is to be obſerved in all Fairs as well as at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and without this no full Power, &amp;c. is of any effect againſt the Principal; but the Creditors muſt look to him who pretended the full Power.</p>
               <p>VI. Proteſts for Non-acceptance need not be ſent away before the ending of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective terms of Payments, but advice muſt be given thereof before; the time of payment begins the day after the aforeſaid ſix dayes of acceptance are expired, unleſs it be a Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and then the day after, and continues to the end of the Moneth; none may pay a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60840:129"/>Bill before the ſixth day, but on his own ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and after the laſt day of Payment the Poſſeſſor may refuſe, if he will, to accept of payment, and may return the Bills and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, and demand Re-change and Charges of the Drawer or Endorſer; but Proteſts for Non-payment may be made any time within three dayes after the term of payment is ended; if then not made, the Drawer and Endorſers are not lyable to anſwer.</p>
               <p>VII. Poſſeſſors of proteſted Bills muſt ſeek their Redreſs on the Drawers and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſers within a certain and fixed time, <hi>viz.</hi> all Bills drawn or made within the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> within two Moneths time; drawn on <hi>Italy, Sweitzerland, England, Holland, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> within three Moneths time; <hi>Spaniſh, Portugal, Polonia, Sweeden, Denmark</hi> Bills within ſix Months time, or elſe he loſes his Redreſs on the Drawer and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſers.</p>
               <p>VIII. All Bills payable in any payment are accounted fully paid and ſatisfied, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Inhabitants, within one year, and of Strangers within three years after the ſame ſhould have been paid, and the Poſſeſſor of the Bill hath no redreſs on the Acceptant after ſuch a time, unleſs he make it appear that he endeavoured to procure payment and could not.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> Of Debt-Exchanges.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IN a pure and real Exchange the Drawer receives Monyes of the Remitter, and gives Bills of Exchange, wherein he promiſeth himſelf, or by his order to pay the value he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, according to the conditions in ready Moneys; but in mixed or Debt Exchanges the Drawer receives no Monyes, but is Debtor, and gives Bills to his Creditor (who is reckoned and accounted of as the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) for payment of his Debt.</p>
               <p>II. Such Bills are made either for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of old Debts, or elſe to aſſure the Creditor of preciſe payment for thoſe Goods the Debtor hath bought at time.</p>
               <p>III. Whether the Debtor make the Bills payable by himſelf, or by any other, or whether the Debtor and Creditor agree about the courſe of Exchange or not, the Debt doth change its nature, and the Debtor that gives a Bill of Exchange upon himſelf, or
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60840:130"/>another, doth make himſelf lyable to the Law of Exchanges, and may upon failure of payment be proſecuted with ready executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, attachment upon Goods, and arreſt upon his Perſon.</p>
               <p>IV. A wiſe Creditor will at the Receipt of ſuch a Bill from his Debtor make an abſolute agreement and contract concerning the Courſe, and preſently upon the Receipt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, credit his account of Goods, and debit his account currant for the Value.</p>
               <p>V. Its not neceſſary in a Bill to expreſs whether the Value was paid in Monyes, or was Reſcontered, or in Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if the Debtor do but effectually receive the Value, or it tend to the diſcharging or leſſening his Debt.</p>
               <p>VI. He that gives a Bill for the payment of an old Debt, or for Goods bought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he muſt demand of his Creditor an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, wherein he acknowledgeth ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſuch an old Debt, or ſuch Goods, in ſuch and ſuch a Bill of Exchange received, or for ſo much of the Debt as the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change reacheth to.</p>
               <p>VII. And in ſuch a caſe the Creditor, if wiſe, will demand a <hi>Recipiſſe</hi> (or a Note)
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60840:131"/>from his Debtor, wherein he confeſſeth the Receipt of the Value of ſuch a Bill, either in an old Debt, or for Goods bought, either for the full payment thereof, or for leſſening the ſaid Debt.</p>
               <p>VIII. When a Creditor hath received a Bill from his Debtor in full, or in part of his debt, he muſt not be perſwaded by his Debtor in caſe he at the day of payment be not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, under pretence to leſſen the Charges, and not to diſguſt the Debtor, not to follow the ſtrict courſe and law of Exchanges by proteſting, &amp;c. nor ſhould give the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant longer time if he deſired it, unleſs the Debtor do give him under his own hand, that if he do ſo, it ſhall be no prejudice to him, and this notwithſtanding he ſhall have the Law in force againſt himſelf, as if he had actually proteſted in due form and courſe; for without this the Debtor might diſown any ſuch order or requeſt made to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, and in caſe he pay not, ſet his Creditor at defiance, as having neglected his time and right, and he the Debtor is therefore not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to anſwer.</p>
               <p>IX. When the Creditor receives a Bill from his Debtor, by him drawn on another in another place, with requeſt to demand the ſame, and in caſe of payment to place it to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60840:131"/>his account in full, or part of payment of his Debt, then let the Creditor ſpeak with the Debtor, whether he ſhall draw or remit the product, and alſo know of him, by whom he ſhall cauſe demand to be made, that in caſe of loſs there may be no diſpute.</p>
               <p>X. The Bills that a Creditor makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his own Correſpondent, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Debtor, when he cannot conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently pay that which he ſhould pay at the day of payment, muſt be reckoned to be mixed or Debt Exchanges.</p>
               <p>XI. When it falls inconvenient for the Debtor to pay his Debt at the time, and he deſires a longer time, promiſing ſatisfaction for the time, if it alſo fall inconvenient for the Creditor to wait, then uſually, if the Creditor be ſatisfied in the ſufficiency of his Debtor, at his requeſt he may draw on his own Correſpondent for his Debtors account, with order to revalue the ſame at the day of Payment on his Debtor.</p>
               <p>XII. If a Creditor draw thus for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Debtor, he ought (to the end the Debtor may know what Sum he is to pay for the Re-change) make thoſe Bills ſingle and apart for the juſt Sum that his Debtor muſt pay, or at leaſt order his Correſpondent
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60840:132"/>to keep an account of ſuch a ſpecified Sum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and to revalue the ſame.</p>
               <p>XIII. And to diſtinguiſh the account apart, the Creditor or Drawer uſually orders the Acceptant to draw on the Debtor, with his obligation, or upon himſelf, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Debtor.</p>
               <p>XIV. Its alſo uſual, that one Friend to pleaſure another, draws on his Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>per Cento</hi> apart (for a ſeperate account, and to be kept apart) that the Friend may have the uſe of the Monyes till the time of the payment of the Re-change.</p>
               <p>XV. In all caſes the Acceptant looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Drawer, who muſt anſwer for the Draughts and Re-draughts, but the loſs by Exchange, and the Charges muſt come to the Debtors, account or to his account whom to pleaſure, or for whoſe account the Bill was drawn.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVI.</hi> Of Diſcounted or Reſcontred Exchanges.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IN a real compleat Exchange there is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally four ſeveral Perſons concerned, as, the <hi>Drawer,</hi> the <hi>Remitter,</hi> the <hi>Acceptant,</hi> and the <hi>Poſſeſſor of the Bill;</hi> but in a Diſcounted or Reſcontred Exchange the <hi>Drawer</hi> and the <hi>Remitter</hi> may be one and the ſame Perſon, and that in four ſeveral caſes; As,
<list>
                     <item>1. When he hath to draw and to remit both together, from and to one place, and both for his own account.</item>
                     <item>2. When he hath to draw for one and to remit for another.</item>
                     <item>3. When he hath to remit to one, and to draw for another account. And,</item>
                     <item>4. When he muſt draw for another, and remit for a thirds account.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>II. He that is Drawer and Remitter both for his own account, and draws on one, and remits to another Correſpondent, may make and calculate the courſe of Exchange in his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60840:133"/>Books as he pleaſeth, and need give no man any account thereof; but he that Diſcounts for anothers account either way, muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay either adviſe his Correſpondent, or his Principal, or both, the true courſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, as then it was effectually agreed on at that time on the Exchange, and in caſe the Courſe hath either greatly advanced or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined that day, then in equity he ought to allow his Principal the middle Courſe.</p>
               <p>III. In a diſcounted Bill, where the Drawer is the Remitter alſo, he ought to expreſs the ſame in theſe words <hi>[The Value in my ſelf]</hi> but if he will not that the Acceptant ſhould know ſo much, then he may make the Value of any other, adviſing the Poſſeſſor, that he himſelf is the Remitter, and the other Name is but added <hi>pro Forma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. If any draw or remit for anothers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who is not named in the Bill, its not neceſſary to adviſe that the Value is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.</p>
               <p>V. He that diſcounts in himſelf, and gives advice thereof, whether it be done with or without a Bill in <hi>Formâ,</hi> neither may nor can re-call the ſame, without the conſent of thoſe that are concerned.</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:60840:133"/>
               <p>VI. He that hath an opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, may place Courtagie to his Principals account, though he pay none; and ſo if any ſtand good for the Remiſes, or ordinarily hath done, may alſo place uſual Proviſion to account, though he run no <hi>riſco</hi> or hazard.</p>
               <p>VII. One and the ſame Perſon may in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other reſpects, repreſent two, or more Perſons, in Exchanges; for he can be, 1ſt, <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſor.</hi> 2dly, <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant.</hi> 3dly, <hi>Remitter</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſor.</hi> 4thly, <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> and <hi>Acceptant.</hi> 5thly, <hi>Drawer, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. When any makes Bills, payable to himſelf or order, he is both Drawer and Poſſeſſor of the Bill, till he draw it in or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſe it: <hi>Scaccia,</hi> The ſtile of Merchants hath introduced this Cuſtom, contrary to the Axiom of the Common Law, that a man may pay to himſelf.</p>
               <p>IX. But Drawers ſeldom make Bills payable to themſelves, when he they draw upon is with them, or they themſelves with others in good Credit.</p>
               <p>X. Great Prudence is to be uſed in nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating Bills, payable to the order of the
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:60840:134"/>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:60840:134"/>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:60840:135"/>Drawer, becauſe ſuch Bills are uſually drawn on thoſe that begin to halt, and are accepted before they be drawn in, and the Drawer makes uſe of them to furniſh himſelf with Moneys in a neceſſity.</p>
               <p>XI. He that makes Bills payable by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and accepts of the ſame to pay them, he is both Drawer and Acceptant.</p>
               <p>XII. When a Drawer accepts his own Bill, and promiſeth to pay the negotiated Sum, then he need not accept the ſame again; But if he direct the Bill to himſelf, as if he were a Stranger, then let the Poſſeſſor or the Remitter get him to underwrite, <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. When a Bill, payable by the Drawer, is not proteſted within the Reſpit dayes, then the Poſſeſſor doth not loſe his Right, becauſe he as Acceptant, is, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains obliged; but he looſeth his Redreſs on the other Endorſers, if it be endorſed.</p>
               <p>XIV. When the Reſpit dayes of a Bill, payable by the Drawer, are expired, then the Poſſeſſor is obliged to proceed, according to the law of Exchanges, by ready Execution againſt his Perſon and Goods, without being
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60840:135"/>obliged to return the Bill and Proteſt, to the place from whence it was done.</p>
               <p>XV. When a Remitter orders the Bill to be made payable to himſelf or order, then he is both Remitter and Poſſeſſor, till he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſe and negotiate it.</p>
               <p>XVI. Remitters order their Bills to be made payable to their Orders, ſometimes becauſe they know not themſelves to whom they ſhall be payable, ſometimes becauſe they will not let the Drawer know to whom they remit.</p>
               <p>XVII. A Remitter remitting for anothers Account, does very ill, if he (though he ſtand <hi>del credere</hi> for the ſame) order the Bills to be made payable to himſelf, or order, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſe the ſame to his Correſpondent; the Reaſons are in the 8th Rule of the 27th Chapter.</p>
               <p>XVIII. When the Remitter orders his Bills, to be made payable to him on whom the Drawer draws, (who is the Acceptant) then is the Poſſeſſor the Acceptant, and the Bills are then made, <hi>Pay to your ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. When any is Poſſeſſor and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of a Bill, and he will not accept of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60840:136"/>ſame for account of him, for whom it is drawn, then he may and muſt proteſt againſt himſelf, as poſſeſſor of the Bill, (if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent and the Drawer be two diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) as if he the Acceptant were another diſtinct Perſon for Non-acceptance, and ſend both the Bill and the Proteſt back to him from whom he received it, that he may make uſe thereof againſt the Drawer. And thus alſo he may if he will accept <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> in honour of a Drawer or Endorſer, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>XX. When any Acceptant is to pay to himſelf, and he returns Anſwer that he hath, or will accept the draught, then he cannot repent thereof, nor cannot afterwards, by a Proteſt for Non-acceptance, or Non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, help himſelf.</p>
               <p>XXI. If any be drawn upon in a Bill payable to himſelf, and he accepts of the ſame, in ſuch a caſe the day of Payment is reckoned to be the very day it falls due, which paſt, the Bill is accounted as paid, no reſpit dayes being allowed.</p>
               <p>XXII. When a Drawer makes Bills, payable to himſelf, or order, and Reſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or finds the value in himſelf, then is he Drawer, Remitter and Poſſeſſor. The Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can alſo be the Remitter and Acceptant,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60840:136"/>and Poſſeſſor and Acceptant, and ſo in three reſpects, he can repreſent three diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; thus alſo the Remitter can be the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant, and Poſſeſſor and Acceptant, and this all at once; but theſe caſes ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>XXIII. In Exchanges, two Perſons can each of them have two Relations; As,
<list>
                     <item>1. One can be <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Remitter,</hi> the other <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> and <hi>Acceptant.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Acceptant,</hi> and <hi>Remitter</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſor.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> and <hi>Remitter</hi> and <hi>Acceptant.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And he that repreſents two or more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, may do all that any of them might do, if diſtinct and ſeveral Perſons.</p>
               <p>XXIV. When a Drawer and Remitter, and the Poſſeſſor and Acceptant are but two diſtinct Perſons, each of them repreſenting a double Perſon, then there is a double diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or reſconter; and this for the moſt part happens betwixt Correſpondents, that have open Accounts each with other, and for other accounts, and one hath occaſion for Moneys in one place, the other in the other. But this Exchange can be performed without formal Bills of Exchange, alone by advice and correſpondence, about adjuſting the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60840:137"/>courſe of Exchange; but if any third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be concerned therein, then its moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to make formal Bills of Exchange.</p>
               <p>XXV. The advice of the Acceptant to the ſaid Drawer, that he hath taken notice of, and conform to the advice from the Drawer hath placed the Draught to account, &amp;c. doth ſo firmly oblige the Acceptant, (whether a third Perſon be concerned therein or not) as if he had accepted a formal Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
               <p>XXVI. When the Acceptant is Poſſeſſor of the Bill, and the Drawer is the Remitter alſo, and the Acceptant ſcruples the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Draught, according to advice; in ſuch a caſe its not neceſſary for him to proteſt againſt himſelf, becauſe its enough for him to return the Bill, with advice, that he is not inclined to accept the ſame.</p>
               <p>XXVII. When a Drawer draws upon himſelf, and the Remitter orders the Bills to be payable to himſelf or order, then the Drawer is the Acceptant, and the Remitter the Poſſeſſor of the Bill; and in this form are uſually all Debt-exchanges made (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treated in the former Chapter.)</p>
               <p>XXVIII. It may fall out, but its very
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60840:137"/>ſeldom, that a Drawer makes Bills payable to himſelf, by the Remitter, and then the Drawer is Poſſoſſor, and the Remitter Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant of the Bill.</p>
               <p>The Remitter may alſo be an Acceptant, when he hath to remit for his own, or any others account, and negotiates with him, who muſt draw upon him, which may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall out.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. If the Poſſeſſor of a Bill be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the Acceptant, a juſt and liquidated Sum already due to him, the Acceptant may diſcount with him, and this is good and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Payment: But if it be not a liquida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sum, the Acceptant cannot diſcount, nor if the Poſſeſſor who procured the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, have endorſed it to another, unleſs he can prove that the preſent Poſſeſſor hath paid no Value, and that this was done by them only <hi>pro forma,</hi> and to defraud him. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IN ſuch Bills as theſe the Drawer doth not abſolutely oblige himſelf to payment, but on a certain condition agreed upon.</p>
               <p>II. And in theſe Bills the condition muſt be clearly expreſt, on which condition the Acceptant muſt accept and pay, elſe not; wherefore if the condition be not expreſt, theſe kinds of Bills are lyable to great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes and Conteſts.</p>
               <p>III. The Acceptance of a conditional Bill obligeth the Acceptant (whether he be the Drawer himſelf, or any other) abſolutely to the Payment, if the Condition agreed upon be performed, or the Poſſeſſor will oblige himſelf to the performance thereof.</p>
               <p>IV. The Poſſeſſor of ſuch a Bill is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obliged to perform the Condition, ſometimes not; Exchanges grounded upon
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60840:138"/>impoſſible, or unlawful, or indecent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> null and void.</p>
               <p>V. When he is abſolutely obliged to the performance of the Condition, its not enough for him to mortifie the Bill, and not demand Payment thereof, but he is obliged to make good to the Acceptant the Loſs and Intereſt that the Acceptant, or any other concerned therein, for Non-performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is likely to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>VI. When the Poſſeſſor of a Conditional Bill is not abſolutely obliged, then if any thing happen without the Poſſeſſors fault, that may hinder him from performance of the Condition, this does not alwayes free and diſcharge the Drawer or Acceptant, but he is in ſuch a caſe obliged to pay the Bill, though the Poſſeſſor do not perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if he will but make good the loſs to the Acceptant or Drawer.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Now when <hi>B.</hi> accepts the Bill, then he is obliged upon the delivery of the Pack to pay to <hi>C.</hi> the Sum expreſt in the Bill, though the Says ſhould fall conſiderably in Price be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time. But if the Says are loſt at Sea, and never arrive, then the Acceptance is null and void, and the Bill is mortifyed; and if they are damaged only, and do arrive, then <hi>B.</hi> muſt receive them, and pay the Bill he accepted; but he muſt deduct from the Value, as much as impartial Merchants ſhall judge the damage may be eſteemed at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>A.</hi> is conſidered as the Inſurer.</p>
               <p>VII. Amongſt conditional Bills, Bills of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60840:139"/>Bodomery may be reckoned, that is, Bills that are made upon the Keele of the Ship, which are accidentially conditional, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard its not in the power of the Poſſeſſor, but only depends on Providence, to give a Ship a proſperous Voyage.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Bodomery-Bills that are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and other places in the <hi>Levant,</hi> wherein the Shipper acknowledges the Receipt of ſuch and ſuch Goods into his Ship, from <hi>A.</hi> to deliver the ſame upon ſafe arrival to <hi>B.</hi> and that the ſaid Goods are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with a Debt of a 1000 <hi>Reals,</hi> upon Bodomery at ſo much <hi>per cento,</hi> the value re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of <hi>C.</hi> payable ten dayes after the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Ship;
<list>
                     <item>To <hi>D.</hi> for his own Account, 300 <hi>Reals.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>To <hi>E.</hi> for the Account of <hi>F.</hi> 300.</item>
                     <item>To <hi>G.</hi> for the Account of <hi>H.</hi> 400 <hi>Reals.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This being underwrit by the Shipper, is as much as a conditional Exchange, which if <hi>B.</hi> accept, then he is obliged to make good and pay the Sum, and may receive the Goods, paying the Shipper his Freight and Avaridge; but if there be extraordinary Avaridge, or if the Goods be damaged, then the Sum of the damage, and of the extraordinary Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge, muſt be deducted from the Sums that <hi>D. E.</hi> and <hi>G.</hi> are to receive, they being as Bodomerers or Aſſurers.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:60840:140"/>
               <p>IX. They to whom Goods are addreſſed that are incumbered with Bodomery, are as little obliged to accept of the Bodomery-Bills, as an Acceptant is obliged to accept Bills drawn upon him; but if they have once accepted, they are then according to the Law of Exchanges obliged to make punctual Payment at the day appointed.</p>
               <p>X. If any to whom Goods, burdened with Bodomery, are addreſt, refuſe to accept the Bodomery Bills, then the Poſſeſſors of the Bills are obliged to make Proteſts for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance, and then may requeſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to authorize him to receive the Goods, and to ſell them, and diſpoſe of them to him that will give moſt, or that they may be put into the Hands of another to be diſpoſed of, that out of the product of the Goods the value of the Bodomery-Bill may be ſatisfied; but they muſt have a care of acting any thing in this matter, without the Authority of the Magiſtrate, nor muſt they without his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, admit any other to honour the Bills, and receive the Goods, and diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>XI. When all this is done by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Magiſtrate, as above is declared, and there is found to be more made of the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60840:140"/>Goods than was required, to the diſcharge of the Bodomery-Bills, then that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Hands of the Perſon that had the Goods in diſpoſal, or be paid into the Hands of the Magiſtrate, for the uſe of the true Owner of the Goods. But if there be ſhort of what the Sum in the Bodomery-Bills re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, then the Poſſeſſors of the Bills have no Redreſs upon him, to whom the Goods were addreſſed, nor upon the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Owner thereof, no, not upon the Factor or Loader of the Goods, or the Drawer or Receiver of the Moneys paid upon Bodome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unleſs he hath by a ſpecial Contract ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himſelf thereunto.</p>
               <p>XII. Among conditional Exchanges may be reckoned, thoſe Bills that are given upon account of any Wager made, or for the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things that are yet <hi>in dubio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. Bills made upon account of a Wager, &amp;c. are either ſingle, or reciprocal and mutual.</p>
               <p>XIV. Single are they, when one gives Moneys, and the other receives it at the ſame time, accepts a formal Bill of Exchange, payable to him that gave the Moneys, for the payment of a greater Sum than he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the day of Marriage, or at the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60840:141"/>of ſuch and ſuch a Belſagured City, &amp;c. or at any other uncertain and dubious event.</p>
               <p>XV. If in the caſe of Wagers, if Moneys be not given by the one, and received by the other, the Law allows no advantage againſt him that gives the Bill; but if he have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Moneys, then he is obliged to repay the ſame, with Intereſt, and no more.</p>
               <p>XVI. Conditional Exchanges for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, are two-fold; for ſome tend to the Security of the Drawer or Remitter, ſome to the Security of the Poſſeſſor.</p>
               <p>XVII. Conditional Exchange, that is, for the Security of the Drawer or Remitter, are ſuch Bills as an Out-dweller makes, or cauſeth to be made, for the diſcharge of other Bills by him accepted, which muſt be paid in another place, or ſuch as any man makes, to diſcharge Bills drawn, but proteſted for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance, or if accepted, for Non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the Drawer had timely notice of his Acceptants failure, or that he would not pay.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Conditional Exchanges, that are for the Security of the Poſſeſſor, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as are for the Security of the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60840:141"/>Re-payment, and are made after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>

               <p>XX. When a conditional Bill is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, or if accepted, is not paid, then the Poſſeſſor may proteſt and ſeek his Redreſs and the Recovery of his loſs by the Drawer.</p>
               <p>XXI. In a Proteſt of a conditional Bill, whether for Non-acceptance or Non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Poſſeſſor muſt look to this, and obſerve that he inſert and prove that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60840:142"/>was performed, or elſe that he was ready and willing to perform the ſame, or elſe the Proteſt is of no value.</p>
               <p>XXII. <hi>Sigiſm. Scaccia,</hi> In caſe the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of a conditional Bill, who is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to the performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, would mortifie the Sum, and will not demand payment, nor perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then the Acceptant may compel him thereto, by depoſiting the Monyes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt the Poſſeſſor for Non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Condition, and for all Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and preſently thereupon proceed againſt him, according to the Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Exchanges, and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he, the Poſſeſſor, would have done ſo againſt the Acceptant, if he had been tardy.</p>
               <p>XXIII. If a Condition, whereon an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-Contract is grounded, were once poſſible after the Poſſeſſor had procured Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Bill (if the Poſſeſſor were obliged to perform it) or after the Remitter received the Bill from the Drawer (if the Remitter obliged himſelf to performance) and after wards ſhould be morally impoſſible, they neglecting the opportunity, yet they will be oblig'd to make good all the Damage and Loſs that the Drawer or Acceptant, or any other concerned, can prove they ſuffer
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60840:142"/>by it, becauſe this Condition was the cauſe of the Contract. <hi>Seaccia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIV. But as the Poſſeſſor of a Bill is obliged to demand and procure Acceptance, &amp;c. ſo in this caſe the Acceptant or the Drawer, &amp;c. is obliged to demand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Condition; for, <hi>Ebentus Conditionis, non conſituit debitoram in mora, ſine interpellatione.

               <p>XXV. A Condition may be ſaid to be performed, though it be not actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Poſſeſſor, if another do it by his order, or if another that is concerned in it own it as <hi>quaſi</hi> performed, and this will oblige the Acceptant to pay: As thus; If <hi>Titius</hi> pay to <hi>Sejus,</hi> then pay to <hi>Thomas, &amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Sejus</hi> and <hi>Titius</hi> diſcount, or if <hi>Sejus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelf ſatisfied, the Condition is performed. <hi>Scaccia.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. VVHen any hath a Debtor, on whom he would draw, and yet would
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60840:143"/>not run the hazard of having his Bill return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he may make Bills <hi>pro forma,</hi> payable to the order of his Friend, or to his Servant, and to make the Bill more formal, he may inſert, that he hath received the Value of another, though he hath not.</p>
               <p>II. Another mans Name, in a Bill <hi>pro forma,</hi> may be uſed as Remitter, with or without his knowledge or conſent, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a feigned Name may be uſed.</p>
               <p>III. It may be done without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or conſent, when the Bill is made pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a third, or any other Perſon, or his order; and in ſuch a caſe a known or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Perſon may be named as the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea, a feigned Name, it may be what it will.</p>
               <p>IV. Another mans Name may be uſed as Remitter, with his conſent, when the Bill is made payable to him, or to his order.</p>
               <p>V. When a feigned Name is uſed, or any true Name, without the Perſons knowledge, and only <hi>pro forma,</hi> then the Drawer muſt neceſſarily adviſe the Perſon to whom, or to whoſe order it is payable, that the Value is only ſet <hi>pro forma,</hi> and the Name is feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or uſed without the Perſons knowledge,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60840:143"/>and therefore he the Drawer ſends the Bill himſelf. But if any mans Name be uſed with his conſent and knowledge, then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Bills are made payable to his order, whoſe Name is uſed, who is Remitter <hi>pro forma,</hi> and then this ſaid Remitter <hi>pro forma</hi> acts as if he were effectually the Remitter, demanding Acceptance and Payment in his own Name; and thus the Correſpondent need not know but that the Bill is real, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he muſt know the truth, and that the Bill was only made <hi>pro forma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. There ought circumſpection to be uſed, in conſenting to the making uſe of a mans Name, in a Bill <hi>pro forma,</hi> payable to his order; for ſuch Bills cannot be drawn in, nor will they be paid, but upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſing of the Bill, by him to whoſe order its payable; and an Endorſment, if it be only at the requeſt of the Drawer, and <hi>pro forma,</hi> doth oblige the Endorſer to the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of the Bill really and abſolutely, and not formally only.</p>
               <p>VII. When a Bill, wherein another mans Name is uſed <hi>pro forma,</hi> is made pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his order, and is drawn in, or nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated and endorſed by the ſame Remitter, <hi>Pro forma,</hi> then the Poſſeſſor of the Bill muſt make good the value to the Endorſer, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60840:144"/>not to the Drawer, though he know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Endorſers Name is only uſed <hi>pro forma,</hi> except the Endorſer hath given an Order under his Hand, to make the ſame good to the Drawer, or unleſs the Endorſer be abſent, and at the requeſt of the Drawer had only endorſed it in <hi>blanko,</hi> and yet then the Drawer is obliged to ſecure the Poſſeſſor of the Bill from all Damage and Pretences that the Endorſer may hereafter make.</p>
               <p>VIII. He that to pleaſure his Friend, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his Name to be uſed <hi>pro forma,</hi> as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, willingly and knowingly, and does draw in and endorſe the ſaid Bill, whether he receives the Value himſelf, and afterwards ſends it, or pays it to the Drawer, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he aſſign the Drawer upon it, and lets him receive it himſelf, he ought (though the whole Negotiation concern not him at all) to take notice thereof in his Books, and formally enter it, at leaſt, in his Waſte-Book for Memories ſake.</p>
               <p>IX. When a Bill, <hi>pro forma,</hi> is made pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any mans order, and is drawn in and endorſed, the Endorſer doth moſt prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he receive the Value himſelf, or order the Drawer to aſſign upon him, that the Drawers Aſſignation may be his Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:60840:144"/>
               <p>X. When any draws upon his Debtor, and to prevent Loſs by proteſting, makes the Bills payable to the order of any that will, after Acceptance procured, draw it in, or order his Correſpondent to receive it, and <hi>pro Formâ</hi> makes the Value received, he muſt obſerve well whoſe Name he makes uſe of, and to whom he ſends ſuch a Bill, that in caſe the ſaid Remitter, <hi>pro Formâ,</hi> ſhould happen to draw in the ſaid Bill, and the ſame ſhould be proteſted for Non-payment, and the Endorſer ſhould be Inſolvent, he the ſaid Drawer ſhould be obliged to pay the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to the Poſſeſſor of his Bill, without having received the Value, or if the ſame ſhould be paid, he do not change a bad Debtor for a worſe, and quite loſe his Monyes.</p>
               <p>XI. When a Drawer dare not draw in the Bill, the Value wherefore he hath made received <hi>pro Formâ,</hi> fearing the Acceptant ſhould not accept, or not pay if he did accept, and therefore makes his Bill payable directly to ſome living at the ſame place with his Debtor, and does adviſe the ſaid Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that for Reaſons known to himſelf, the Value is made received <hi>pro Formâ</hi> only; in ſuch a caſe the Poſſeſſor muſt be prudent, in caſe the Drawer is not very ſufficient and honeſt, for he ought not pay the Monyes he
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60840:145"/>hath received on that Bill, unleſs the Perſon whoſe Name is uſed in the Bill, do order him to follow the Directions of the Drawer in the diſpoſal of it, or unleſs the Drawer give him other ſufficient ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>XII. Among Exchanges <hi>pro formâ</hi> muſt be reckoned; thoſe Bills that are drawn on Debtor, but are ſent to the Drawers Creditor to be paid to him, or his Order, the value of the ſame <hi>pro formâ,</hi> concerning which Bills he makes no agreement with the Creditor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Courſe, only requeſting him to procure Payment, and place it (when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) to his account.</p>
               <p>XIII. A Debtor that gives ſuch a Bill to his Creditor, may demand a Receipt from the Creditor, wherein he acknowledges the Receipt of the Bill, and that his Name, as Remitter, is only uſed <hi>pro Formâ,</hi> and that he doth oblige himſelf to demand the ſame, and when paid, either to remit it or make it good to the Drawer (or Debtor) according to the courſe of Exchange; but in caſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the Sum, the Drawer or Debtor ſhall not put to any further Charge for Proteſts, Poſtidge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIV. A Creditor that accepts of ſuch a Bill from his Debtor would do well and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60840:145"/>wiſely to let the Drawer or Debtor give him a Note under his hand, whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the ſaid Creditor to ſend his Bill to his Correſpondent, or to demand acceptance and payment, that in caſe the Monyes ſhould be received by the Correſpondent, but not remitted to the Creditor, or being remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Remiſes are not paid, or the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor not proteſting in due manner and form, &amp;c. the Debtor may have no occaſion to complain of his Creditor, and force him to ſtand to the loſs.</p>
               <p>XV. When in ſuch a caſe the Debtor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with his Creditor concering the courſe, whether before or after the Acceptance thereof, and does credit his account currant for the ſum; or elſe when another, whoſe Name is uſed <hi>pro Formâ,</hi> agrees for the courſe with the Drawer, and pays him the Value, then this Exchange, <hi>pro Formâ,</hi> loſes its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and becomes real and actual; and in caſe of proteſt, the Drawer is obliged to make good the Re-change and Charges.</p>
               <p>XVI. When ſuch a Bill, at the requeſt of the Debtor, is by the Creditor drawn in, and the Value is made him good in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count currant; in ſuch a caſe the loſs by Re-change and the Charges come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Drawer or Debtor; but if the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60840:146"/>Creditor draw in the Bill without the order of the Drawer or Debtor, then he himſelf muſt bear the loſs, if any happen.</p>

So that the diſtance of places is a Subſtantial or Eſſential part of Exchanges, and as the Marrow and Soul thereof, which being awanting in theſe ſorts of Exchanges, they are therefore called, <hi>Cambia Sicca,</hi> Dry Exchanges.</p>
               <p>II. In this kind of Exchanges, ſometimes the Sum to be repaid, for the Sum received, is fixed, determined and certain, ſometimes uncertain and accidental.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:60840:146"/>
               <p>III. When the Sum to be re-paid is fixed and certain, then the Giver hath a certain and fixed Profit and Advance, which is alſo contrary to the nature of Real Exchanges, and this is properly called the <hi>

And ſuch a one doth ſecure his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes better by ſuch a Bill of Exchange than by any Obligation whatever, becauſe if the Bill be not paid at the day punctually, he hath preſent Execution ready at hand, by Attachment and Arreſt, and he hath prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before all other Demanders, as if he had a Judgment confeſt.</p>
               <p>VII. An Uſurer hath alſo this advantage by ſuch Bills of Exchange, that the Sum to be paid is only mentioned in the Bill, not the Sum that was received, ſo that it cannot be known what Intereſt ſuch a one receives.</p>
               <p>VIII. With theſe kind of Exchanges, the Exchanges upon <hi>Frankford's</hi> Fair and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn have a great Affinity, when the Drawer and Remitter do negotiate together upon the Return, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IX. The Value agreed upon to be re-paid is uncertain and accidental, when in the bargaining they agree concerning the Courſe to ſuch and ſuch a Place or Fair; but the Drawer is obliged to pay his Monyes in the place where he received it, and in ſuch a Courſe as ſhall be at the time of payment, to ſuch a certain place.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:60840:147"/>
               <p>

               <p>This ſort of Exchange is very frequent and uſual in <hi>Italy,</hi> and is condemned by the <hi>Papists</hi> as unlawful, grounding their Decree againſt them upon the <hi>unlawfulneſs and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of gaining Monyes upon Monyes, or giving Monyes upon Intereſt, or to have a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the Loan, or Exchange of Monyes.</hi> But our common Uſurers account this no ſin—<hi>Sigiſm.

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XL.</hi> Of Bills of Exchange being loſt.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. VVHen any Bills are made for a Sum of Monyes, uſually two or three are made of the ſame date and tenor, that if one be loſt, the Remitter or Poſſeſſor may make uſe of the other.</p>
               <p>II. When the Poſt goes uncertainly to any place, on which Exchanges are made, or by Sea, or when the Remitter orders the Bills to be made payable to his order, with a deſign to ſend the firſt directly to the place, that Acceptance may be demanded, and to draw in the other ſome other way by endorſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, &amp;c. then three or four Bills may be made, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>III. When the Remitter declares to the Drawer, that the Bills he received are loſt, and that he cannot find them, and deſires the Drawer to re-pay the Value to him, offering to ſecure him from all damage for the future; then the Drawer doth very imprudently if
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60840:148"/>he do it, though the Monyes was for his proper account, and he could otherwiſe do it with little inconvenience to himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Remitter muſt be content to take new Bills, and cannot compel him to reſtore the Value.</p>
               <p>IV. And in giving new Bills the Drawer muſt uſe prudence and circumſpection, and ſee that he make his new Bills of the ſame date and tenor of the former, only adding this difference, that if he had given a <hi>prima</hi> and <hi>ſecunda</hi> before, he now follow the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and give a <hi>tertia</hi> and <hi>quarta</hi> Bill. And yet,</p>
               <p>V. No prudent Drawer will after the day of Payment of his former Bills, give his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter <hi>tertia</hi> and <hi>quarta</hi> Bills, unleſs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter give ſufficient ſecurity to indemnifie the Drawer.</p>
               <p>VI. Its the Duty of all Poſſeſſors of Bills, to have a ſpecial care of their Bills, and to keep them ſafe; and a prudent Merchant will, upon the Receipt of any Bills with blank Endorſments, fill them up, and perfect them, leſt he ſhould loſe them, and another find them.</p>
               <p>VII. As ſoon as a Poſſeſſor obſerves that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60840:149"/>he hath loſt a Bill, he ought inſtantly, at leaſt before the day of Payment, to adviſe the Acceptant thereof, that he pay it to none but to him or his order, and if any other come to receive it, to take notice of him.</p>
               <p>VIII. When the <hi>prima</hi> accepted Bill, which is made payable to Order, is at the place where the payment muſt be made, and he to whoſe order the ſame is payable, againſt the day of payment, when he will draw in the <hi>ſecunda,</hi> cannot find the <hi>prima</hi> accepted Bill, but hath loſt it, and hath no <hi>tertia</hi> nor <hi>quarta</hi> Bill from the Drawer, nor can get them from the Drawer, he being dead or abſent, &amp;c. yet the Parcel may be drawn in and negotiated, if the Endorſer (in caſe his Hand-writing and Seal be unknown to the Acceptant) do ſend a full Power and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Attorney to him to whom he would have it payable, to receive the ſame; but if the Endorſers hand be well known, and he himſelf be to be credited, then an order in writing to the Acceptant, to pay it to ſuch a one, is ſufficient, he engaging to ſecure him from all damage, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IX. But then alſo, a prudent Acceptant will pay no Bill that is payable to order, though by him accepted, if the ſame, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the ſame tenor, is not endorſed as
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60840:149"/>it ſhould be, and ſhown to him, no, not upon the order of him, whom the Remitter or Endorſer hath ſo impowered, till the very laſt reſpit hour, and not then neither, but upon the delivery and ſurrender of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Bill.</p>
               <p>X. When the Poſſeſſor of a Bill, made payable to him directly in <hi>Banco,</hi> cannot find or hath loſt the Bill, then there is little or no danger to either Party, for there Bills are paid or writ of, without the demanding or delivery of the Bills to the Acceptants: But if the Bills are payable <hi>per</hi> Caſh, or in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Moneys, then a prudent Acceptant will not pay a Farthing till the laſt hour of Reſpit, if his accepted Bill be not preſented, and then ouly to the Poſſeſſor himſelf, or to his order, and upon his or their Security from further damage.</p>
               <p>XI. When any hath loſt his accepted Bill, payable to order, the <hi>ſecunda</hi> whereof unaccepted is orderly endorſed till it come to him to whom its payable; when he preſents the ſaid Bill on the day of payment, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant is obliged to pay the ſame upon Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity given, either to deliver up the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bill, or to indemnifie the Acceptant, and to diſcharge from all future demands of the ſaid Sum.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:60840:150"/>
               <p>XII. When any miſſeth his accepted Bill, whether directly payable to the Poſſeſſor, or to his order, and the Poſſeſſor thereof pretends to have loſt it; or if the Poſſeſſor hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that his Remitter hath remitted him at ſight, <hi>ſuch and ſuch a Sum, in ſuch and ſuch a Bill,</hi> &amp;c. and when he opens his Letter, he finds no ſuch Bills; or if he receives not the Letter, wherein the Bill was incloſed, but hath advice thereof by the next Poſt, and finds that the Day of Payment draws near, then he may demand Payment upon his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of advice, offering Security to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant, to free and diſcharge him from all future demands of that Sum, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that loſt Bill; and if the Acceptant will not then pay it, then he can aſſign the Value upon him, and if he pay not then, he may proteſt for Rechange and Charges.</p>
               <p>XIII. When an accepted Bill, proteſted for Non-payment, is loſt, then the Drawer is not obliged to make good the Rechange and Charges, unleſs he get ſufficient Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to indemnifie him, and free him from all future Demands, with promiſe to reſtore the Sum with the Intereſt, that the Drawer paid for the Rechange and Charges, in caſe it be made appear that the Bill pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be loſt, ſhould afterwards be paid
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60840:150"/>by the Acceptant, or any other <hi>ſupra Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIV. When an accepted Bill is loſt, or cannot be found, then the Remitter or the Poſſeſſor cannot proceed againſt the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant by preſent Execution, nor againſt the Drawer, but they muſt make uſe of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Means and Methods, as if it were ſome other kind of Debt; for a Proteſt cannot be made but upon an accepted Bill.</p>
               <p>XV. The Security for diſcharge of thoſe that pay accepted, but loſt Bills, ſhould be limitted to a certain time, after the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof the Security ſhould be vacated.</p>
               <p>XVI. <hi>Marius</hi> adviſeth, that ſo ſoon as the Bill is known to be loſt to the party that had it, that he go inſtantly to the Acceptant, with a couple of Witneſſes and a Notary, to ſignifie the ſame to him, and to charge him at his Peril, to pay it to none but thoſe he ſhall order.</p>
               <p>XVII. And further he adviſeth, that no man that hath accepted a Bill ſhould refuſe Payment thereof, becauſe the Bill it ſelf is not to be found, for thoſe are but flams and ſandy Foundations: But he aſſerts, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt being made for Non-payment, upon the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60840:151"/>offer of ſufficient Security to ſave him harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he, the Acceptant, as the wilfull occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner thereof, is obliged to make good all the loſs, Rechange and Charges.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Suppoſe the <hi>prima</hi> accepted loſt Bill was made payable to him that loſt it, and the <hi>ſecunda</hi> unaccepted Bill, ſhould be made payable to another man, then the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys being really paid at the time, to him to whom the <hi>prima</hi> accepted, but loſt Bill, was payable; this Payment is good and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and the Poſſeſſor of the <hi>ſecunda</hi> Bill, hath nothing to ſay to the Acceptant.</p>
               <p>XIX. Suppoſe the <hi>prima</hi> accepted Bill ſhould be found by a Stranger, who demands the Money in the Name of the party to whom payable, or that the true Poſſeſſor ſhould have aſſigned it over to another man, and taken up the Value, yet this all ſignifieth nothing, coming after the time, and the Money being paid to him to whom it was payable (though without the accepted Bill) and he having good Security to be ſaved harmleſs: But he that is guilty of the Fraud may come to ſmart for it.</p>
               <p>XX. In caſe a Bill of Exchange be loſt by the Acceptant, with whom it was left to be accepted, or that he hath given the Bill to a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60840:151"/>wrong party, or if in any caſe the party that left the Bill for acceptance, cannot have his Bill again, neither accepted nor unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In this caſe the party that loſt the Bill, muſt give a Note under his Hand and Seal for the payment of the Moneys at the day, to the party to whom it was payable, or to his order, upon the delivery of the <hi>ſecunda</hi> Bill, if it come in time, or upon that Note, if it come not in time, which Note is in all caſes to have the Law and Priviledge of a Bill of Exchange; if the Acceptant refuſe this, Proteſt muſt inſtantly be made for Non-acceptance, and then again at the time the Poſſeſſor, though he hath neither Note nor Bill, muſt demand the Moneys, and if not paid, proteſt for Non-payment.</p>
               <p>XXI. He further adviſeth all Merchants, to keep Letter-Caſes, or Paper-Books in their Pockets, to keep Bills of Exchange in, that they may be the better ſecured from loſing.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XLI.</hi> Of Letters of Credit.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. IN this Chapter we muſt follow the famous <hi>Marius</hi> his advice, the <hi>Hollands</hi> Author, not taking any notice of Letters of Credit in his whole Book, which makes up ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial a part of the Myſtery of Exchanges.</p>
               <p>II. Merchants make ſpecial uſe of all their Letters, and do not only ſafely keep all they receive, but Copy alſo all the Letters they ſend away; and above all things, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Credit ought to be ſafely kept by the Receiver, and fairly copied out by the Writer.</p>
               <p>III. Merchants Letters are of ſeveral ſorts, and accordingly have ſeveral Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; as, there are Letters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which are properly orders to Buy or Sell, to Freight and Ship, &amp;c. <hi>2dly,</hi> There are Letters of advice, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Bills of Exchange, whereof we have treated in one Chapter before. <hi>3dly,</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Freight, which may be either Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-parties,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60840:152"/>or Bills of Loading, &amp;c. And <hi>4thly,</hi> there are Letters of Credit, which are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch, which are written to our Friend, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor or Correſpondent, to furniſh Monyes to a third Perſon upon Exchange, upon the Credit of the Writer of the Letter.</p>
               <p>IV. Theſe Letters of Credit are of great Concernment, and do as much oblige the Parties that ſubſcribe them, as accepted Bills of Exchange do, in caſe he to whom they are writ, upon the Credit of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, ſhall comply therewith; and the Honour and Credit of the Subſcribers is as much concerned therein, as in Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
               <p>V. It will not be neceſſary to caution Merchants to be careful and circumſpect, in furniſhing any with Letters of Credit, and to adviſe them to give none but upon good Security.</p>
               <p>VI. Letters of Credit are of two ſorts; the one is General, the other Special.</p>
               <p>VII. The General Letter is, when an open Letter is given to any, directed to all Merchants and others, to furniſh Monyes unto ſuch and ſuch Perſon or Perſons, upon that Letter of Credit, whereby the Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60840:153"/>doth oblige himſelf, that what Moneys ſhall be by them delivered unto the ſaid Party or Parties, therein mentioned within ſuch and ſuch a limitted Time, at ſuch and ſuch a Courſe (or at the Courſe currant) to be acceptable and anſwerable for the ſame, to be repaid according to the Bill or Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, which upon Receipt of the Moneys ſo furniſhed, upon ſuch a general Letter of Credit, ſhall be delivered for the ſame.</p>
               <p>VIII. If any Moneys be furniſhed upon ſuch a general Letter of Credit and Bills of Exchange, directed to the Subſcriber, be preſented, the Subſcriber is by virtue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of obliged to accept, and in caſe he refuſe, he may be compelled thereto, and to pay at the day, by attaching of his Goods, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting of his Perſon, and that more then the Drawer, in regard the Remitter, in giving his Moneys to the Drawer, had not ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ability and ſufficiency of the Drawer, as to the Credit and Repute of the Subſcriber of the Letter of Credit, who is in this reſpect, reputed as the Drawer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>IX. Wherefore its very dangerous to give ſuch Letters of Credit, that are general and unlimitted to any but thoſe that are of our intimate and real Acquaintance; and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60840:153"/>alſo its very dangerous for any to give Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys upon ſuch a Letter of Credit, in regard the Drawer may prove Knaviſh, and take up more Moneys than the Subſcribers are able to pay, ſo that both the givers of Moneys may come to loſs, and the Subſcriber be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruined in a moment, both in his Eſtate and Credit.</p>
               <p>X. The Special Letter of Credit, is, when a Merchant gives to any other man his open Letter, directed to his Factor, Servant, or Correſpondent only, ordering him to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch and ſuch a Perſon or Perſons with ſuch and ſuch a limitted ſum of Moneys, at one or more times, and to charge his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count therewith, and to take Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change or Receipts for the ſame.</p>
               <p>XI. To prevent Frauds, and the jealouſie the Factor or Correſpondent, to whom ſuch a ſpecial and perticular Letter of Credit is directed, may have concerning the Truth and Reality of this Letter of Credit its expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that the Merchant that gives it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it with his own Hand, and affix his uſual Seal; and not this only, but alſo, that he adviſe thereof by Poſt once or twice, and inſert in the ſame ſomething or other, that may be as a particular token of the certainty thereof, at leaſt the Date of the laſt Letter
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60840:154"/>he writ, and of the laſt Letter he received, with ſome of the Contents thereof.</p>
               <p>XII. General Letters of Credit being ſeldom given to any, by any Merchant, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſign of better carrying on his own trade, the Monyes taken up being imployed for his own uſe, and improved for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, therefore he never takes any Security from the Merchant he ſo credits, &amp;c. But he that gives to another a perticular Letter of Credit, for whoſe Uſe and Service the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys is to be imployed, he ought, if he be prudent, to have good Security for repayment of all ſuch Moneys as ſhall be received by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ſaid Letter of Credit, before he do ſubſcribe and deliver the ſame.</p>
               <p>XIII. For the Merchant ſtands ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound and obliged to his Correſpondent, by his Letter of Credit, and therefore its but reaſonable, that he that receives the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Credit ſhould give a ſufficient Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecurity.</p>
               <p>XIV. There is no difficulty in the form of either the General or Perticular Letter of Credit, wherefore it will be needleſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert one, nor in the forms of the Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change grounded upon this Letter of Credit, wherefore they are here omitted.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="42" type="chapter">
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:60840:154"/>
               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XLII.</hi> Of what is, and is not to be done; or what Party concerned in an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is, and is not obliged to do, in caſe any that are concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhould fail.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. WHen a Remitter fails before he pay the Value, and the Bill be by him drawn in and endorſed, or ſent away and accepted, the Acceptant is notwithſtanding obliged to pay it at the time, though the Drawer hath not received his Monyes. But in regard, on this manner a knaviſh Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a cunning Poſſeſſor underſtanding one anothers deſigns, may commit great Frauds, its neceſſary that the Poſſeſſor prove that he or his Correſpondent have effectually paid the Value, or that the ſame is remitted to him by the Remitter for a juſt and true Debt he had to demand of him. <hi>NB</hi> Wherefore let the Drawer never part with both the Bills, till he hath received his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:60840:155"/>
               <p>II. When the Acceptant of a Bill, the Value whereof was not paid to the Drawer, does at the day of payment refuſe to pay, or is inſolvent, then the Poſſeſſor may ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs by the Drawer, and he is obliged to pay the Re-change, even of that Bill where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he never received the Value (And <hi>NB,</hi> by <hi>Re-change</hi> here and elſe-where, is meant, the whole Bill which is advanced with the Re-change, Proviſions and Charges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be paid) and not the bare Re-change only, which is the Monyes that exceeds the Value of the firſt Bill; and this is indeed a very hard Leſſon, but yet muſt be ſubmitted to.</p>
               <p>III. Yea, if in ſuch a caſe the Drawer hath drawn for his own account, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the loſs by Re-change hath remitted the Value to his Correſpondent, to diſcharge his Bill, or hath ordered his Acceptant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value upon him, whoſe Re-draughts he hath accepted; and the Acceptant yet for all this, inſtead of paying his Bill, runs away with his Monyes, or is inſolvent and cannot pay, ſo that the Bill returns with Proteſt; yet notwithſtanding this, the Drawer is obliged to re-pay the Re-change and Charges, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60840:155"/>ſo twice to ſupply the Value of that Bill whereof he received no Value at all.</p>
               <p>IV. When a Remitter falls before he pay the Value, and the Acceptant get notice thereof before he accept, and therefore refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to accept, ſo that the Bill returns with Proteſt, yet the Drawer is obliged to pay the Re-change, if the Poſſeſſor can prove that he negotiated the ſaid Bill, and paid the Value for it; but if the Bill be made directly pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any Perſon, and the Remitter ſends him the Bill in payment of what he is endeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Poſſeſſor, then its a great queſtion whether the Drawer be obliged or not, if he hath received no Value, nor the Poſſeſſor any otherwiſe hath made good the Value.</p>
               <p>V. And though a Drawer in ſuch a caſe muſt pay more than the Remitter is endebted to him for the Value (<hi>viz.</hi> the Re-change and Charges) yet the ſaid Remitter is Debtor for no more than the bare Value, nor can any more be demanded of him.</p>
               <p>VI. When a Drawer for another account receives not the Value, then the loſs comes charged on the account of him for whoſe account it was drawn, unleſs the Drawer ſtood <hi>del Credere,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>del Credere</hi> hath reſpect to the Remiſes, and the whole Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60840:156"/>or, unleſs the Drawer gave the Remitter ſome time for the payment of the Value, and adviſed not his Principal thereof, or unleſs the Drawer had neglected to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Value in due and ordinary time, or unleſs (I may add) the Remitter were a man known to be inſolvent or declining; in any of theſe reſpects, whether the Drawer had any profit or no, the loſs will fall upon his own account, becauſe he credited the Remitter.</p>
               <p>VII. When the Drawer fails before the Value be received, then the Remitter, if he hath the Bills yet in his hands, may reſtore them either to the Creditors of the Drawer, or to the Curators of his Effects, and if either of theſe think that he is obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Contract, and that he muſt pay the Value, and demand Acceptance and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bills, the Remitter is obliged to attempt the ſame, but with this Proviſo, that the Creditors or Curators that urge him thereto, give ſufficient ſecurity for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and Charges, in caſe he negotiate the ſame, and it be returned with Proteſt, which they muſt do before he is obliged to pay the Value to any of them.</p>
               <p>VIII. If a Remitter hath conditioned for any time for the payment of the Value,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60840:156"/>or if he cannot pay the Value, the Bank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut, and in the mean time, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Drawer, he accepts of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation for the Value, payable to a third Perſon after the expiration of the Term agreed on, or after the opening of the Bank, (whether this Acceptance be verbal only, or written) the Remitter is obliged thereby to pay the Value to the third Perſon at the due time, although the Drawer ſhould fail before that time be expired, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IX. If the Remitter or Poſſeſſor of a Bill have been negligent in demanding Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the Drawer in the mean time fails, but the Acceptant not knowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of before acceptance is demanded, if he do accept, that Acceptance obligeth to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though procured after the failure of the Drawer, as well in reſpect of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant himſelf, or any other for whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Bill was drawn.</p>
               <p>X. If the Remitter or Poſſeſſor have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to demand Acceptance before the Drawer failed, then the Acceptant cannot be compelled to accept of the Draught, though the Acceptant hath writ to the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he would accept ſuch a Bill, and though he confeſs, he ſhould have accepted it if the acceptance had been timouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60840:157"/>and before he had knowledge of the Drawers failure.</p>
               <p>XI. When any have Bills ſent them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand acceptance thereof, and to keep the ſame by him, or to return them to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, or any other that he ſhall order, if they by negligence or forgetfulneſs delay to demand acceptance, or ſuffer the Acceptant to delay and defer the acceptance, and the Drawer in the interim ſhould chance to fail, and then the Acceptant ſhould abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe acceptance, ſuch a one deſerves ſmall thanks from the true Owner of the Bill; but he is not obliged to make good the Value. But on the contrary, if Bills be effectually remitted to any, and they be urged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure acceptance and payment, &amp;c. if they defer and delay to procure the ſame, if the Acceptant (being yet ignorant of the fear'd evil circumſtances of the Drawer) declare he ſhould have accepted, if it had been timouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demanded, they are obliged to their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent who remitted the Bill, to make good the loſs occaſioned by their negligence, but further not.</p>
               <p>XII. When a Bill is drawn in and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed by ſeveral Perſons before the ſame be accepted, and afterwards acceptance being demanded, is refuſed, becauſe the Drawer
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60840:157"/>is fail'd, then the loſs falls upon the firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer, whoſe duty it was to have procured Acceptance, wherein being negligent, he can only blame himſelf for having no better ſecurity, and muſt hope then on his fail'd Drawers recovery.</p>
               <p>XIII. When an Acceptant hears of the failure of the Drawer before acceptance be demanded, he ought not to accept any Bills of his, though he had advice from the Drawer, that he would draw; and while he was yet ſuppoſed to be in <hi>bonis,</hi> and returned anſwer, that he would accept, in ſuch a caſe he muſt upon no account to pleaſure the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, or any other, accept thereof, without ſufficient ſecurity to be diſcharged from all and every one that ſhall make any pretence or demand thereof, whether the Drawer, his Creditors or Curators, or his Principal for whoſe account it was drawn.</p>
               <p>XIV. Nor may the Acceptant accept any Bills from the failed Drawer, though the date of the Bill be before his failure, and the Letter of advice of the ſame date with the Bill, whether it come with the ordinary Poſt or not, becauſe there is great ſuſpicion (and its but too apparent in this caſe) that there is ſome Fraudulent under-hand-dealing, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60840:158"/>that the Bill and the Letter are truly anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated.</p>
               <p>XV. If any be drawn on for the account of a third, and he before the acceptance hath advice of the failure of the Drawer, he ought not to accept the ſame, though he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Drawer that he would, becauſe ſuch his acceptance may tend to his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, if he hath not effects in his Hands for the Perſon for whoſe account will ſcruple, and juſtly, the making good of the Value; and it will be at leaſt to the Principals damage and Prejudice, if he hath the effects in his Hands to anſwer to thoſe Bills.</p>
               <p>XVI. Eſpecially he ought not to accept any Bills, if the Perſon for whoſe account the Bill was drawn by the failed Drawer, hath adviſed him of the failure (or ſuſpicion of the ſaid Drawers failure) and therefore hath forbidden him to accept any of the ſaid Drawers Bills for his account, though he had ordered the Acceptance thereof before.</p>
               <p>XVII. When the Drawer fails, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant is not obliged to make preſent Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to give him better Security; but the Poſſeſſor muſt wait till the day of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before he can domand any thing of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60840:158"/>the Acceptant, and then the Acceptant muſt pay, though he accepted for the Drawers account, and he hath no effects of the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in his Hands.</p>
               <p>XVIII. The Poſſeſſor of a Bill, the Drawer whereof is fail'd, and payment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denyed by the Acceptant, is not obliged to return the Bill and Proteſt to the place whence it was drawn, becauſe its too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that the Rechange and Charges cannot be recovered from the Drawer, but he muſt inſtantly without delay, after the Proteſt is made, proceed againſt him, by attaching of his Goods and arreſting of his Perſon, which no Magiſtrate ſhould refuſe to grant; and its to be noted, that its one thing when the Drawer is yet in <hi>bonis,</hi> and another when he is fail'd.</p>
               <p>XIX. When an Acceptant fails, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf, then the Poſſeſſor is obliged, ſo ſoon as he gets notice thereof, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of Payment, inſtantly without delay to inquire the truth thereof, and if true, by a Notary publick order a Proteſt in due form to be made, and ſend the ſame with the Bill to the Remitter, to procure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from the Drawer, and advice ought to be given directly to the firſt Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not to the laſt Endorſer only, that the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60840:159"/>Drawer may, if he pleaſe, order another to honour his Bills, and prevent the loſs by the Rechange, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>XX. But yet though the Poſſeſſor, either out of Negligence or Ignorance of this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, or Ignorance of the failure of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant, or becauſe the Bill made payable to order, comes not till after its fallen due, or for any other cauſe does not, or cannot, make this Notarial Proteſt, nor ſend it away, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before nor after its due, till probably on the laſt Reſpit day; yet this Negligence or Ignorance, notwithſtanding the Poſſeſſor doth not loſe his Redreſs on the Drawer and Endorſer, though the Acceptant fail'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bill became due.</p>
               <p>XXI. When an Acceptant fails before the day of Payment, and the Poſſeſſor doth order preſently a Proteſt to be made, then if the Bill be made payable to order, he doth wiſely if he ſend only the Proteſt away to the firſt Remitter, and keeps the Bill till the ſame fall due, that in caſe the Drawer order any other to honour his Bills in time, the Poſſeſſor may be ready to receive the Value.</p>
               <p>XXII. If any other offer to accept and honour the Bill, whoſe firſt Acceptant fail'd, in honour of the Drawer, or any other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60840:159"/>in ſuch caſe the Poſſeſſor is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to accept of ſuch an offer, if he look not on the offerer as very ſufficient and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; but if he be ſufficient, or will give ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent caution, then the Poſſeſſor muſt accept of his offer, and cannot refuſe it.</p>
               <p>XXIII. But none can or may accept ſuch a Bill (whoſe Acceptant is fail'd) ſafely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Proteſt for Non-payment, declaring the Evil circumſtances of the Acceptant; and ſuch an Acceptant in honour muſt preſently ſend the ſaid Proteſt, together with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries Atteſtation of his acceptance in honor to the Drawer, or to him for whoſe account he accepted.</p>
               <p>XXIV. Though it be certainly known, and the Drawer himſelf muſt confeſs, that the Acceptant of his Bill is failed, yet he is not obliged to give any caution, ſecurity or ſatifaction to the Remitter till the Proteſt be produced; but if the Remitter or Poſſeſſor have the Bills returned without the Proteſt, or the Proteſt without the Bills, or both the Proteſt and the Bills, and ſhows them to the Drawer, then he is obliged inſtantly to give ſatisfaction or ſecurity for the Re-change and Charges.</p>
               <p>XXV. Yet let no wiſe Drawer make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtution
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60840:160"/>of the value he received, or of the Rechange and Charges upon the producing of the Proteſt for the inſolvency of the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; but upon the producing thereof, being required thereto, let him give ſecurity for the payment thereof at the place where it is payable, if there be yet time enough, or of the Re-change, when the Bill by his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Acceptant, accepted, is produced, which Bill, if it be not produced, he need not reſtore or repay any thing, but upon ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſecurity to deliver the Bill, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him from all future demands, and to make Reſtitution thereof with Intereſt, in caſe the ſaid Bill be paid to any <hi>ſupra</hi> Proteſt; but if there be not time enough to order the payment of the Bill at the place where it was payable, then let the Drawer give ſecurity to pay it to the Remitter in the place where it was drawn, when the time of the Bill ſhall be expired.</p>
               <p>XXVI. A Drawer or Endorſer is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Poſſeſſor of a Bill proteſted for the failing and inſolvency of the Acceptant, as much as if the Bill was proteſted for Non-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance (whereof ſee <hi>Ch.</hi> 13.) &amp; further not.</p>
               <p>XXVII. When the Drawer, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Remitter, hath made his Bill payable to order, and that Bill is afterwards
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60840:160"/>endorſed and drawn in from ſeveral places, and ſhould, in caſe of the failure of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant, be returned the ſame way they came, then the Drawer may tell the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to whom he may addreſs himſelf for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the day, giving ſufficient ſecurity for the payment thereof, which if he do, he is not further obliged to any, nor for more than the Charges of Proteſt and Poſtidge, and the Remitter muſt accept hereof, and accordingly order his Correſpondent to make his addreſs to ſuch a Perſon; but the Drawer muſt order his Friend not to pay any Monyes but upon the receipt of, or ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the delivery of the poteſted Bill, with the Proteſt.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. When any is drawn on and remitted to, in Bills payable to himſelf, and he hath adviſed that he accepts of the Draught, if this Acceptant and Poſſeſſor of the Bill ſhould chance to fail before the Bill fall due, then the loſs falls upon the Drawer, or on him for whoſe account the Bill was drawn, and he is obliged to make good the Re-change and Charges, though it be not proteſted in due form and courſe; but if he fail on the day of payment, or after, then the Bill is looked upon as paid, and the loſs falls upon him for whoſe account was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:60840:161"/>though it ſhould formally be proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the dayes of Reſpit.</p>
               <p>XXIX. When a Sum is drawn for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a third, and the Bill is for his account accepted, if he for whoſe account is drawn ſhould fail, without making Proviſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the accepted Bill, yet the Acceptant muſt pay it, and hath no redreſs on the Drawer.</p>
               <p>XXX. If a Bill be drawn by the order and for account of a third, and is accepted by the Acceptant, if the Acceptant fail, the Drawer muſt make good the Re-change and Charges, but yet he hath his redreſs on him for whoſe account he drew, and may charge his account therewith, though the ſaid Perſon hath already made ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion good to the Acceptant, or hath accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Acceptants Bills for the Value, and if both the Acceptant, and the Perſon for whoſe account was drawn, ſhould fail, the Bill being accepted, the Drawer may then come upon them both for ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>XXXI. When a Bill drawn and accepted for the account of a third, and the Acceptant fails before he, for whoſe account the Bill was drawn, hath made the Acceptant ſufficient
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60840:161"/>Proviſion for the diſcharge thereof, if the Drawer ſhould alſo fail, then he for whoſe account was drawn need not ſuffer himſelf to be perſwaded to pay the Bill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, becauſe it was drawn for his account, unleſs the Poſſeſſor will give him ſufficient ſecurity to ſave him harmleſs, both from the Drawer and Acceptant, and their Creditors, Aſſigns and Curators, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>XXXII. When the Acceptant of a Bill fails before Proviſion is made to diſcharge the ſame, and the Drawer fails alſo, then he for whoſe account was drawn and accepted, need not diſcharge the Bill and pay the value, either to the Acceptant, his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Curators, unleſs it appear to him that the Poſſeſſor is ſatisfied by the Acceptant, or ſome others for his account, and doth relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh all pretences to both the Acceptants and Drawers effects, or unleſs he be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſecured from all damage that may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue upon the account of the ſaid draught and acceptance.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. When the Poſſeſſor of a Bill, payable to his order, fails, and to defraud his Creditors, endorſeth the Bill to another, who negotiates the ſame, and effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Value, and doth again endorſe it to a third, &amp;c. yet though the Creditors
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60840:162"/>ſhould oppoſe it and diſcover the Fraud, the Acceptant muſt pay it to him who comes to receive it, if he can prove that he paid the Value thereof really; but if the failed Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor had made it payable to any other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, he may probably be allowed Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but he muſt prove how and when he paid the Value, and muſt Swear, that before the failure of the Endorſer was known, the ſame Bill, without any Colour or Fraud, was delivered to him before he may receive the Principal; (if the Creditors oppoſe him) and if he refuſe to do this, he muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Farthing of the Sum, or if he hath received it, he muſt be obliged to reſtore it for the uſe of the Creditors in common, and muſt alſo be obliged to draw in and endorſe the Bill that he received from the failed Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor to defraud them.</p>
               <p>XXXIV. When a Bill payable in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Monyes, is made or endorſed payable to any Poſſeſſor, that is unknown to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant failed, before the day of Payment, if he afterwards pay the ſame to him, his failing being unknown, ſuch Payment is good and vaild; but if he pay to any other, upon order of the Poſſeſſor, and know of the failing of the ſaid Poſſeſſor, he does very unwiſely, and runs the hazard of paying it twice.</p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:60840:162"/>
               <p>XXXV. When the Poſſeſſor of a Bill fails, and the Acceptant can prove and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that the Bill was remitted for the Poſſeſſors account, or upon account of what the Remitter or any other for whoſe account it was remitted, was indebted to the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, and therefore he only is the true Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Principal of the Bill, then the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant may pay it to him, and he muſt credit the Perſon for whoſe account it is for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. But if the Bill be for the account of a third, or for the Drawers account, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them have received any valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration from the Poſſeſſor for it; in ſuch a caſe it ought to be paid to him, in regard the failed Poſſeſſor is not the true Owner of the Bill, but only the demander of Satisfaction; and the Acceptant ſhould be obliged at the day of Payment to pay the ſame to the next order of the Remitter, or the true Owner of the Bill for whoſe account it is.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. If a ſuſpected Poſſeſſor of a Bill ſhould Fraudulently twice draw in effectually the ſame Bill, and give the <hi>prima</hi> Bill to one man, with directions to find the <hi>ſecunda</hi> Bill accepted, and the <hi>ſecunda</hi> Bill to another, with directions where to find the <hi>prima</hi> accepted, then he only hath right and title to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes that firſt procures acceptance (he not
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60840:163"/>finding any accepted Bill, as he was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) whether it be the firſt or ſecond Bill that is accepted, it makes no matter, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were firſt or laſt negotiated by the fraudulent Endorſer.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. When the Poſſeſſor of a Bill that is fail'd, to defraud his Creditors or others, conceals it, and they afterward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that ſuch a Remiſe muſt yet be in his Hands, or ſuch a draught is, or at leaſt was in his Hands, then the Acceptant is obliged to declare whether he hath accepted ſuch a draught, to which if he anſwer affirmatively, the Creditors, or any other concerned, may forbid the Acceptant to pay it, without their or his knowledge and conſent; and if any appear at the day of payment to demand pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is obliged to declare, that he is the true poſſeſſor of the ſaid Bill, and prove it; if none appear, then the Acceptant is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to pay the Sum to the Creditors or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators of the failed Poſſeſſor, they giving ſecurity that the Acceptant ſhall in no wiſe be prejudiced thereby, or if he ſcruple to do it upon their Security, he may pay it into the Hands of the Magiſtrate, for the account of the true Owners thereof; and if the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant refuſe this, the Creditors or Curators may unanimouſly proteſt againſt him for non-payment, and ſend the ſame to the Remitter
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60840:163"/>to procure ſatisfaction of the Drawer, and if he make no Satisfaction, then they may compel the Acceptant thereto.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. When a Bill is made pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the order of any that is failed, before the Bill be come to his hands, if he receive the Bill and endorſe it, making it payable to any other that demands acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the Acceptant accepts thereof, being ignorant of the failing of the firſt Poſſeſſor, in ſuch a caſe the Acceptant may, getting knowledge of the failing of the firſt Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and that he was failed before he endor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſaid Bill, not pay the Value to his order, becauſe the failed Poſſeſſor, after his failing, had no power or quality to endorſe a Bill of Exchange, and therefore the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant doth wiſely to offer to make Payment thereof to his Creditors or Curators, upon ſufficient Security to be indemnified, which if they accept not of, let him ſuffer the ſaid Bill to return with Proteſt.</p>
               <p>XXXIX. Its not without ſuſpicion of Fraud when the Debtor of an inſolvent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to have a Reſconter, becauſe that he at the requeſt of the failed, when he was yet in <hi>Bonis,</hi> accepted a Bill, or under-writ a <hi>tertia</hi> Bill, payable to ſome of the failed's Creditors, and that he paid the ſaid Bill he
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60840:164"/>accepted, or that the Bill, the <hi>tertia</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſubſcribed, was proteſted, and he forced to pay the Rechange and Charges; for the Debtor and Creditor, or Poſſeſſor of ſuch a Bill, underſtanding one another, and the condition of the failed may eaſily, to the prejudice of the Creditors, make abundance of ſuch Bills after he failed.</p>
               <p>XL. When a Poſſeſſor of a Bill hath neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to procure acceptance in time, and the Acceptant after the failure of the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er refuſeth to accept, then he hath no Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Preferrence more than other Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, to the effects he may have in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptants hands, though the Drawer drew meerly upon thoſe Goods, and would have been accepted, if demanded before the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of the Drawer was known.</p>
               <p>XLI. Though the Poſſeſſor of a Bill, whoſe Acceptant failed before the day of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or within the Reſpit dayes, hath an open account with him, and is Debtor to him for a greater Sum than the value of the Bill imports; and though he may now upon the failing of the Acceptant reſconter, yet he doth more wiſely if he proteſt for Non-payment, and let the Bill return.</p>
               <p>XLII. When the Drawer, or he for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:60840:164"/>whoſe account is drawn, fails before they have made good the promiſed Proviſion to the Acceptant, then the Acceptant paying at the time, or if not accepted, or not paid, but returned with Proteſt, the Drawer hath pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and preferrence before all other Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, upon any of the effects of the failed that they have in their own Hands.</p>
               <p>XLIII. When an Acceptant of a Bill hath Remiſes made to him for Proviſion, by him for whoſe account he accepted, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſaid Draughts with, if he having received the Remiſes, faileth before he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the draughts, then muſt the Principal anſwer the Rechange and Charges, and muſt be content to come into a <hi>concurſus creditorum</hi> with the reſt. But if upon the failing of the Acceptant, the Remiſes be yet found by him, and not yet received, then the Principal that made thoſe Remiſes muſt be preferred to them, and they muſt be paid to his order; and though the Creditors or Curators have received the ſame after the Inſolvency of the failed, yet they muſt repay the ſame again.</p>
               <p>XLIV. The Poſſeſſor of a Bill, proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Non-acceptance or Non-payment, whoſe Drawer and Acceptant are both fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt concur with the reſt of the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not for the Value only that was paid,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60840:165"/>but for the Rechange and Charges, and for the Sum that the Drawer or Acceptant ſhould have paid, if they had been Solvent.</p>
               <p>XLV. If both the Drawer and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant fail, then the Poſſeſſor hath right and title to demand payment of both their Goods and Debts, &amp;c. and he may chuſe with which he will firſt begin, and where he can ſooneſt procure Payment or Satisfaction, and if ones Effects will not ſatisfie his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he may then get as much as he can of the other's, for they are both obliged.</p>
               <p>XLVI. And the ſame right that he hath to the Goods and Debts, or whatever elſe, either the failed Drawer or Acceptant may have, till he be ſatisfied, he hath alſo the like againſt any, or all the Endorſers, if the Bill be returned unaccepted, if they come to fail, and if the Bill be accepted, if the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant, Drawer and Endorſers ſhould all fail, and be Inſolvent, then he may come upon all their Goods for ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>XLVII. The Poſſeſſor may demand the full Sum, with all the Charges out of the Goods and Effects of that failed Acceptant, Drawer or Endorſer, where he firſt gives himſelf on as Creditor, and what he receives there, he may place to account in part of his
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:60840:165"/>Demands, and if not ſatisfied there, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not demand the whole again of another, but only the remainder, and ſo from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till he be ſatisfied fully.</p>
               <p>XLVIII. If the Poſſeſſor of a Bill, whoſe Acceptant, Drawer and Endorſers are all failed, receives ſomething in part of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his demands, if the failed or the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators do thereupon demand an Acquittance with a Ceſſion of the Action to him or them, then the Poſſeſſor muſt not acquit, nor trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more of his Action to him or them, than for the value he hath received.</p>
               <p>XLIX. When the Poſſeſſor hath received of one of the failed, in part ſatisfaction of his Demands, and comes to another of the failed to demand the reſt, then he cannot make a Ceſſion of his Action againſt him, from whom he had received in part ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at firſt, becauſe he was there admitted into the Concourſe for his whole demand, and accordingly received his proportion. So that <hi>NB.</hi> though a Poſſeſſor enter into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with other Creditors, and take in part of his Debt of one of the failed as much as he can get, and thereupon doth abſolutely diſcharge him; yet for the remainder he may come upon the other Endorſers or Drawers, till his Bill be fully ſatisfied, only
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60840:166"/>he cannot transfer or tranſport his Action againſt him whom he hath diſcharged.</p>
               <p>L. When a Poſſeſſor of a Bill, whoſe Drawer, Acceptant and Endorſers are all failed, does firſt receive, in part of his demands, of one of the failed, for whoſe account the Bill was drawn, but hath either drawn, or endorſed, or accepted the Bill for anothers account, without having any effects in his hands, then the Poſſeſſor muſt enter with him, who paid him in part, into a concourſe between themſelves, and both demand of the others (or any one of them) that failed, the <hi>ſubla ſumme,</hi> with the Charges.</p>
               <p>LI. In caſe of the failing of Drawers, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors or Endorſers of Bill, many difficult Queſtions could ariſe, whereof ſome of them are as follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſe either the Drawer or Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſhould fail, and the other remains ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> Whether the Poſſeſſor, to pleaſure him that is yet ſufficient, may (being not requeſted thereto) by virtue of of the Bill, enter upon a concourſe, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he muſt look to him only that is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and leave the other to take care for himſelf?</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:60840:166"/>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe the draught is for account of a third Perſon, and the Accepant fails before Proviſion be made to diſcharge the accepted Bill, by him for whoſe account it was drawn and accepted; ſuppoſe alſo, the Bill being proteſted for Non-payment, the Drawer ſhould proſecute the Acceptant, (or any other Poſſoſſor ſhould do it) and at laſt they come to terms of agreement, and the Acceptant doth then accordingly ſatisfie the Poſſeſſor, whoever he be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> What right of demand theſe either of them have one upon another, or either or both of them, upon him for whoſe account the Bill was drawn?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe the Poſſeſſor of a Bill hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated to proteſt within the days of Reſpit, and the Acceptant ſhould fail, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Effects in Hands for whoſe account he accepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> Whether the Poſſeſſor may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him, for whoſe account the Bill was drawn, and ſo mortifie the Draught; or whether he, for whoſe account it was, muſt fully ſatisfie the Acceptant, and the Poſſeſſor muſt be content to engage in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Acceptants Creditors?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe a Merchant hath no other
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60840:167"/>Debts at all, but one only Bill of Exchange by him drawn for his own account, whoſe Acceptant failing, he alſo is forced to abſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quraeitur,</hi> Whether the Poſſeſſor may ſeize upon all the Effects of the Drawer, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account in part, and for the remainder may be admitted as a Creditor, into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Acceptants Creditors?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Suppoſed, in caſe of the failure of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant, Drawer and Endorſers, the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor ſhould firſt make his demands of the full Sum of him who is the true Debtor, and ought to pay, and the remainder ſhould be demanded (part being there ſatisfied) of the Endorſers, or any other concerned in the Bill, that have only drawn, endorſed or accepted for anothers account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> Whether in ſuch a caſe (this laſt demand being alſo ſatisfied) they that pay to the Poſſeſſor the remainder, may come upon the Perſon who ought to pay, for ſo much as they have paid to him?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Suppoſe that any Merchant ſhould fail, that hath three Creditors only, one demands 600 <hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> Ster.</hi> for Goods ſold, another as much for a Bill of Exchange, drawn by him for his account, whoſe Acceptant failed, and a third as much, upon an Obligation, Bond or Bill, for ſo much Monyes depoſited, having no
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60840:167"/>other Security but his bare Bond. But though there be ſo much Debt, yet the failed Debtor hath no more Effects then 600 <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> 1. Whether this Sum of 600 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> muſt equally be divided among theſe three Creditors or not?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Suppoſe again this being done, the Poſſeſſor of the Bill ſhould come upon the Acceptant for the remaining 400 <hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> Sterling,</hi> and ſhould there be forced to enter with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creditors upon a Concourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> 2. Whether then the ſaid Acceptant may not pretend, that he paying ſo much on the foreſaid failed's account, and ſo becoming his Creditor, that another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the foreſaid 600 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> ought to be made, and he to have part thereof, the ſame may be enquired after, in caſe the Poſſeſſor of the Bond, &amp;c. had any Security, and he forced then to pay the remainder, whether he ought not to admit them as Creditors to the 600 <hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> Sterling?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Suppoſe that Drawer, Acceptant and Endorſer are all fail'd, and have given their Goods and Effects into the Magiſtrates, or any Curators Hands, and the Poſſeſſor ſhould in one place give himſelf on for the full Sum, and receives there ſomething in part, and ſo
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60840:168"/>alſo in another place receives ſomething more; and after ſome time be expired, more of their Debts being come in, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates or Curators ſhould make a ſecond Diviſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> Whether the Poſſeſſor of the Bill, at this ſecond Diviſion, muſt come in for a proportion, according to his reſpective Sums he formerly received, or for what Sum he muſt be admitted?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Suppoſe that Bills of Exchange are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betwixt two, or more, that are failed, for one anothers account reciprocally, and neither of them have open accounts for one another, neither accounts currant, nor upon time, and yet both have Goods unſold in their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> How then the Compoſition muſt be made, and whether what the one hath to debit the other for muſt be adjuſted?</p>

If the Poſſeſſor of a Bill fail before or after the Bill is due, and the Acceptant hath yet in hands, or ſees and knows where to get another accepted Bill, payable by the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, or a proteſted Bill for Non-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, drawn by the Poſſeſſor, which will fall due before or ſoon after the Bill the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Poſſeſſor had payable by the Acceptant, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> Whether in any, or all, or none of theſe Caſes, and in which Reſconter or Diſcount hath place?</p>
               <p>LII. Merchants that fail, not on deſign to defraud their Creditors, or to enrich themſelves by their loſſes, neither occaſion their own failing by their negligence, or Riotous living, but have loſt their Eſtates by croſs Providential Diſpenſations immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as by Fire, Water, Shipwracks, Wars, Pyracies, &amp;c. or mediately by the Knaveries of Wicked Correſpondents and Factors, &amp;c. are greatly to be pitied. and not to be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with the Rigor of the Law.

               <p>LIII.

                  <p>Caſe 2. <hi>Whether ought the Remitter to give the Monyes to the Drawer, or the Drawer give the Bills to the Remitter first,</hi> de jure?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Remitter, who is as the Buyer, muſt give his Monyes firſt; for Good bought for ready Monyes, need not be delivered till the Monyes be paid. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Bill ſayes expreſly <hi>[The value received]</hi> and there is danger to the Drawer to give his Bills away before the value be received. But, <hi>3dly,</hi> Rather than there ſhould among Merchants be any diſpute about this, let the Drawer give the <hi>prima</hi> Bill to the Remitter firſt, and keep the <hi>ſecunda</hi> Bill till he receive his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; for it is but a ſuperſtition, which the Law takes no notice of, neither is it of the Eſſence or Subſtance of a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or other Inſtrument; and though it be uſed by many, and the <hi>Italians,</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and others that he quotes, aſſert the neceſſity thereof, as grounded upon Cuſtom, and as a Note of Diſtinction betwixt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> yet its certain, as the Author confeſſeth, no ſtreſs was ever laid upon it; and I am bold to add, <hi>That it is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and more a Prophaning than an Invoking of the Name of God.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its not ſo abſolutely neceſsary <hi>de jure,</hi> but its yet <hi>de conſuetudine</hi> (that hath obtained the force of Law) abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary; ſo that the Omiſſion thereof doth vitiate a Bill of Exchange; beſides, in Bills of Exchange time is <hi>de Subſtantia Contractus.</hi>

Nor can the Acceptant upon this account, by the ſame reaſon, refuſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and payment, but ſuch Bills may as effectually be proteſted as if they were dated. Nor can the Notary Publick upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text refuſe to make a Proteſt, and the reaſon is this, The date of the Bill is not <hi>de jure,</hi> ſo Eſſential, that the Omiſſion thereof ſhould make it utterly void; for the Body of the Bill will prove the Coutract againſt the Drawer, and againſt all elſe concerned in it, in favour of the Remitter and Creditor.</p>
                  <p>And yet, if the Acceptant refuſe to accept an undated Bill, he doth well, and cannot be prejudiced, yet may ſafely accept it, if he pleaſe, without any fear of Prejudice to him; for all the fault is the Drawers: And if the Poſſeſſor refuſe to proteſt ſuch Bills, the fault is his, and he may make himſelf therby lyable to make ſatisfaction to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, if any Damage ſhould enſue.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the Affirmative, <hi>de Conſuetudine, non de jure,</hi> Its not enough to know that ſuch a Bill was done in the <hi>World,</hi> or in <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> but at leaſt the Name of the City where ſuch a Bill was made muſt be expreſt; and as he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that will accept a Bill of Exchange any way deficient in theſe Circumſtances of Time or Place, ſo alſo is that Poſſeſſor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that becauſe the Bill is deficient, will not proteſt upon refuſal of Acceptance.</p>
                  <p>To this let be added, That if the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant doth accept a Bill, and doth not then obſerve it to be deſicient in any of theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and afterwards will make ſuch Exceptions to avoid the payment thereof, he cannot thereby be excuſed, but muſt pay.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 6. <hi>Suppoſe that this day, the</hi> 3/13 <hi>of</hi> November, Anno 1680. <hi>at</hi> Konigsbrough <hi>in</hi> Preſſia, <hi>I writ Letters to</hi> Hambrough <hi>to</hi> Robert <hi>my Correſpondent there, adviſing him, that I have drawn on him, of the ſame date, ſuch and ſuch Bills, &amp;c. Suppoſe alſo, that inſtead of dating them the</hi> 3/13 <hi>of</hi> Novembris <hi>aforeſaid, they be dated the</hi> 3/13 Octobris <hi>past, or the</hi> 3/13 Decembris <hi>to come.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60840:172"/>they arrive at</hi> Hambrough <hi>by the Poſt the</hi> 11/21 Novembris, <hi>on which day the Letter of Advice is delivered, and the Bills for Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance preſented; The Acceptant he preſently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Error, and begins to ſcruple Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; if he doth accept, he knows not how to place them to account in his Books, becauſe the Dates, which ſhould be orderly, and one Day and Moneth follow upon another in his Books, and it may be he ſuſpects there is ſome piece of Policy (or Knavery rather) in the caſe, and either the anti-dated Bills ſhould not be paid at all, (ſuppoſe they were at ſight) till the</hi> 13/3 Decembris, <hi>or the Poſt-dated Bills (ſuppoſe the term of Payment be expired) ſhould not be accepted at all; in theſe Perplexities of Thoughts has ſtates and fears in the whole, the Deſign is to trapan him, eſpecially if he hath engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under a Penalty to accept all the Bills of ſuch and ſuch a Perſon, for ſome limitted Time and Sums. What ſhall and must</hi> Robert, <hi>my Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, do in ſuch a caſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Robert</hi> not only may, but muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and pay thoſe Bills, though no Penalty were annixed. For, <hi>First,</hi> This pretext of an Error in the date will not excuſe me (the Drawer) from paying the Rechange and Charges, if proteſted, much leſs my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, who muſt obſerve my order, and repreſents my Perſon, and that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:60840:172"/>will not excuſe me, is ſelf-evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in reſpect of me, Time and Place are not of the Eſſence of the Bill, by an Error, or the Omiſſion whereof, the Bill it ſelf ſhould be ſo vitiated as to be null and void. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſe an Error in, or Omiſſion of theſe Circumſtances of Time and Place were of the Eſſence of the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, yet though the Bill be deficient and vitiated, yet the Contract contained in the Bill is valid and firm. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In ſuch a caſe where an Error is ſo evident and palpable, reſpect ſhould be had to the Letters of advice, and if they were alſo wrong dated, yet being its impoſſible that Letters dated at <hi>Konigsbrough</hi> the 13th <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cembris</hi> ſhould arrive at <hi>Hambrough</hi> (an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles off and more) three Weeks before the time of the date. Thus palpable Error muſt give way to Truth, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing the Error is not in the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Contract, but in the formality of the Bill; and theſe Circumſtances are only added as Proofs of the Contract, not as Parties, and of the Eſſence thereof.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 7. <hi>Whether an Error about, or an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Name of the Place be Fſſentially neceſſary to be exprest in a Bill of Exchange?</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>Concerning Acceptance, which preceeds Payment alwayes, we have ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before, Chap. 10, 11, and 12. and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſhall have occaſion to hint ſomething elſe afterwards; wherefore we proceed to ſpeak to ſeveral Caſes concerning the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Bills.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 1. <hi>What is it to pay a Bill of Exchange?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer;</hi> To ſatisfie the Bill, and procure a diſcharge upon it, that the Acceptant and the Drawer may be diſcharged from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter and Poſſeſſor; ſo that to <hi>Pay,</hi> is rather to be referred to the ſubſtance of the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, than to the payment of Monyes; and if the Bill be ſatisfied, its no matter at all whether with Monyes or Goods, or by Reſconter, &amp;c. though ordinarily all Bills are paid in Monyes: and this is certain, that if the Bill be for Monyes, it muſt be paid in Monyes, if the Poſſeſſor will have it ſo; and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60840:174"/>a Poſſeſſor may as well proteſt for Non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if Goods be offered inſtead of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, or any other Species of Monyes than that the Bill requires, (as to pay <hi>per</hi> Caſh when the Bill is payable in Bank) as if no Payment at all were offered.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 2. <hi>How many ſorts of Payments are there? And to whom is the Debtor ſaid to have paid well, and to whom not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer;</hi> There are two ſorts of Payment, <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Improper; Proper</hi> is when the Bills are paid in the preciſe Species, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenor of the Bill, either in Gold or Silver, in Bank or <hi>per</hi> Caſh, in currant law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Monyes, and ſuch Species as the Bill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and ſuch Payment as this doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely diſcharge the Debtor, becauſe the Obligation is fully ſatisfied, and the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor need not be much inquiſitive, who pays his Bill in this kind, whether it be the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor himſelf; or <hi>2dly,</hi> any other by his order, and in his Name; or <hi>3dly,</hi> without his order, <hi>ſupra Proteſt,</hi> in honour of the Bill; or <hi>4thly,</hi> without either Order or Proteſt (if any be ſo fooliſh) the Creditor may from any of theſe ſafely receive his Monyes, and transfer his Action, if he pleaſe; <hi>5thly,</hi> yea, if any will pay againſt Order. But on the contrary:</p>
                  <p>To a full diſcharge of the Debtor, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not only a ſurrender and delivery,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60840:174"/>and a Diſcharge or Acquittance upon the Bill, but he muſt obſerve to whom he pays, and Payment in reſpect of the Debtor is only good, when it is made, <hi>1ſt,</hi> To one ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently authorized and qualified to receive and diſcharge as he is; <hi>2dly,</hi> To whom it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly laſt aſſigned and endorſed; or <hi>3dly,</hi> To him with whom the Contract was made (if there be no Endorſments) or <hi>4thly,</hi> To him for whoſe account the Bill is; or <hi>5thly,</hi> To a Servant of any of theſe, who hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily for his Maſter received Monyes, and given Receits, whereof the Maſters hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; or <hi>6thly,</hi> To the Executors or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators; or <hi>7thly,</hi> To any that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter and the Drawer ſhall agree upon, in caſe they revoke their firſt Order, if the Bill be for the Remitters, or for any thirds accounts; for then, though it be orderly aſſigned and endorſed to another, who is only as the Remitters Factor, if the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forbid the Acceptant to pay him, he muſt not pay, but upon his own hazard, but muſt pay to him whom the Remitter orders; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>To all which may be added, that if the Acceptant pay <hi>mala fidei Poſſeſſori</hi> ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Payment is good, if the Bill other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in all its Formalities be perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Improper</hi> Payment hath all the Effects and Virtue of a <hi>Proper</hi> Payment, though it be
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:60840:175"/>not made in a preciſe Species, nor according to the tenor of the Bill, yet it diſcharges the Debtor as effectually, only the Creditor cannot be compelled to take this, as he may be to take the other, and it muſt be made only to the true Owner of the Bill, to one that hath his order to accept of ſuch payment, elſe it is not good nor ſufficient, nor will the Debtor be thereby diſcharged, if the true Owners order hath only a ſimple order to receive Payment, and not poſitively ſuch payment, becauſe no order of the true Owner and Poſſeſſor of the Bill hath power to alter the tenor thereof; whereas if the true Owner reſconter, (or order his Order ſo to do) or take payment in Goods, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in Words declare himſelf ſatisfied, or order him to ſatisfie any other for the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, or to Reſconter with any other; though there be in all this no actual payment of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, in Specie, yet the Payment is good.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 3. <hi>A Poſſeſſor hath ſeveral Bills upon one Perſon, and they all fall due near upon one time, part he pays, and the other part he pays not till a day or two after, (yet within the Reſpit dayes) in the mean time he fails, and cannot pay at all; the Queſtion is, for whoſe Accounts that ſhall be that is paid, or whether the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath power to place it to what Accounts he pleaſeth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:60840:175"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the Debtor expreſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare on what account he pays, if the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor or Receiver be ſilent, and ſo receive it, it muſt neceſſarly be for that account, yea, though there remain another Sum then due, for which the Drawer had given Security, and ſo it may ſeem to be paid in <hi>prejudicium tertij;</hi> yea, and though the Creditor had engaged not to act againſt the Surety, till he had firſt excuſed the principal Debtor; and as on one hand the Surety cannot juſtly complain of the principal Debtor for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it was in his power to do with his own as he pleaſed at that time, and ſo pay for what account he would; ſo neither can it on the other hand, in favour of the Surety, or of the Creditor, be altered, though the Debtor himſelf conſent, becauſe when once paid, it is no more the Debtors, nor hath he any further diſpoſal over it, nor can it be ſaid, that the payment was made to defraud the ſecurity, becauſe the payment was Real, and upon a real account. But if the Creditor had acted at Law againſt the Debtor, and procured execution againſt him, and ſo had ſeized on his Effects, and expoſed them to ſale to pay himſelf, then the caſe is otherwiſe; for then the Debts, for which there are Sureties or Pledges given, muſt firſt be diſcharged, or elſe the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do not as they would be done to.</p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:60840:176"/>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Debtor be ſilent when the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor ſays, he receives for ſuch and ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, then ſuch payments muſt be for ſuch accounts, becauſe its preſumed, that the Creditor herein acts as if he himſelf had been Debtor.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If one of them chuſe, and the other in that moment contradict, the Debtors choice muſt be preferred, and if the Creditor will not receive for thoſe accounts, he ſhould not receive at all, or if received, he ought to make reſtitution, or place it to account, as the Debtor would have it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If both be ſilent, as to the accounts the the Monyes is paid and received upon (or if they would defer it till another time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon, which cannot lawfully be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) then the oldeſt Debt muſt firſt be ſatisfied; and if they are alike old, then <hi>cauſa Durioris,</hi> muſt be preferred, becauſe its moſt neceſſary, as if any Surety be engaged for the Debtor; in this caſe it would be very hard that he ſhould ſuffer. Yet,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If the Debt be for Intereſt and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and the Debtor pay any Monyes upon that account, though the Principal be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, yet the Law always ſuppoſeth that the Intereſt muſt firſt be paid, becauſe men uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gather the Fruits before they pull up the Tree. So alſo,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If there be a Surety for one part of the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60840:176"/>Debt, and a Pledge for the other, though (neither in this nor the former caſe) the Debtor nor the Creditor ſpeak not a word about it, or though they do ſpeak, yet the Law preſumes, that the Monyes paid is firſt to diſcharge that part for which there is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity given, and not for that for which there is a Pledge, becauſe the Creditor can ſell the Pledge when he pleaſeth, and ſo pay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 4. <hi>Whether Preſcription be good Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And how ſoon a Bill of Exchange may be preſcribed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Preſcription is improper Payment; yet being it hath the effect of a Real Payment ſometimes, we muſt therefore enquire, <hi>How ſoon a Bill of Exchange may be preſcribed?</hi> And to this is anſwered, That accepted and duely proteſted Bills, or proteſted for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance, can never be preſcribed, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands be conſtantly made; but if a palpable negligence or ſilence can be interpreted, for conſent, and that out of ſuch a Conſent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription can ariſe, eſpecially the Creditor knowing what the Law in theſe caſes is, and having frequent opportunities to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or to puruſe at Law for Non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or if ſuch a conſent imply a Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Remiſſion or Satisfaction, then we cannot ſuppoſe that any long time is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:60840:177"/>to preſcribe a Bill of Exchange; and the Law preſumes, That when a Debt may conveniently be demanded, but is neither demanded nor proteſted, that then it is paid; and if it were not thus, there would be no end of Controverſies and Diſputes among Merchants; for they many times, when their Bills are paid, either negligently or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of their Creditors honeſty, leave them in their Creditors Hands: And here obſerve, That as to the ready Execution that Bills of Exchange are priviledged with, when proteſted, if not preſently, <hi>&amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> put in execution, when they conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently may, is in ſo far preſcribed, that they then ſignifie no more than any other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Bills or Bonds, which muſt be ſued for in the ordinary Methods.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 5. <hi>If a Creditor upon any pretence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to receive the Monyes due upon a Bill of Exchange, &amp;c. What is then to be done?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Depoſit the Value in the hands of the Magiſtrates of the place, or any other ſufficient Perſons, upon the account of ſuch a Bill, and this ſhall be accounted good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſcharge both the Acceptant and the Drawer, if it be according to the tenor of the Bill.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 6. <hi>If the value of Monyes be inhanced
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60840:177"/>or depreſſed, between the making and diſſolving the Contract by Payment, whoſe ſhall the Profit or the Loſs be?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The value of Monyes may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced or depreſſed two wayes, Intrinſically and Extrinſically; As to the Extrinſick value of Monyes, the loſs, without Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, is the Creditors, and the Profit alſo is, as is aſſerted in the ſixteenth Chapter, fourteenth Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>But as to the Intrinſick value of Monyes; if in this interval of time it be inhanced or depreſſed; if it be of a worſe or a better allay, of greater or leſſer Prize, then the Debter muſt pay according to the value of the Monyes, at the time of making the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; and if any of the old Species of the old value be to be had, he ſhould pay in that Species, whether it be to his profit or to his loſs, and the reaſon is clear, If I borrow any Commodity, to pay again in Specie, both the Extrinſick and Intrinſick Value thereof muſt beconſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for Inſtance:</hi> I borrow of my Neighbour ten Quarters of Wheat, the Quarter being then valued at 40 <abbr>
                        <hi>s.</hi>
                     </abbr> Now when I would pay my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour his Wheat again, if what I will pay with be not ſo good, as that which I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which is the Intrinſick value, there is no reaſon, but I ſhould proportionably give
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:60840:178"/>him again more than the ten Quarters, and if my Wheat be better, there is no reaſon but that proportionably ſo much leſs ſhould be reſtored, I allowing him the uſual lawful Intereſt of his Monyes for the time; ſo alſo, as to the Extrinſick value, ſuppoſed that the Wheat I will pay with, be as good every way, as that I received, but what then was bought for 40 <hi>
                        <abbr>s.</abbr> per</hi> Quarter, may now be worth 50 <abbr>
                        <hi>s.</hi>
                     </abbr> or it may be is fallen and worth no more than 30 <abbr>
                        <hi>s.</hi>
                     </abbr> if the Debtor then pay the quantity, he is diſcharged, nor reſpect being had to the Extrinſick value, the Profit &amp; loſs thereof being the Creditors, as before was ſaid; only let me here add, that we only ſpeak of Bills of Exchange here, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Punctual Payment; whereas if a Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould from time to time put off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay Payment, after its due, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but if there be Loſs he ſhould bear it, and if there be Profit, that the Creditor ſhould have it, becauſe he himſelf the Debtor is in fault.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 7. <hi>If a Creditor of a Bill of Exchange do receive of his Debtor, or of the Debtors Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or of any other, at the Debtors inſtance, other Bills of Exchange, payable at the ſame time by other Perſons; if theſe Perſons pay not, Whether is the Debtor diſcharged or no?

But before theſe Bills are paid, the Perſon they were drawn upon fails; The Question is, whether this Diſcharge be good or no, and you muſt only ſeek your Regreſs upon</hi> Titius? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Diſcharge is good, and you can only ſeek your Regreſs againſt <hi>Titius;</hi> for here is a relinquiſhing the firſt Debtor, and a taking of another in his ſtead, which is a Novation, which doth alwayes extinguiſh the firſt Contract: On this occaſion we may ſpeak ſhortly to five Caſes more of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I am your Debtor, and</hi> Ceulus <hi>his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and I aſſign you upon</hi> Ceulus <hi>to receive your Payment, ordering him to pay you;</hi> Ceulus <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then abſent, you receive my Aſſignation, and deliver me my Bill,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Am I then diſcharged if</hi> Ceulus <hi>pay not?</hi>

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:60840:179"/>obliged, if you have been diligent in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Payment, and could procure none.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The hazard is ſtill the Creditors; for whether the Caſhier were my Debtor, or not, its ſtill an Aſſignation, which diſcharges me from you, for another having undertaken to pay my Debt, and my Creditor being therewith ſatisfied; what more can he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend of me, my Caſhier being alwayes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some ſay the Debtor hath the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe, becauſe here is a clear and expreſt Covent and Contract, and theſe muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, beſides that, <hi>in alternativis Electio eſt debitoris,</hi> as the Law ſays. Others ſay the Creditor hath the better cafe, becauſe this giving of Goods in Payment was only for Security, in caſe the Debtor ſhould not be able to pay, and it was the Creditors Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie to accept hereof; or if the Debtor think he did the Creditor a Courtiſie then, he ought not now to make it turn to his Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Loſs; Beſides, its well known, that he that hath a Pledge for a Debt may, if he pleaſe, ſell the ſame, and pay himſelf, if the Debtor redeem it not within the appointed time.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this caſe, this acceptance of the Bills hath not <hi>bim et effectum ſolutionis;</hi> and this is the common ordinary caſe, far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that 7th <hi>Caſe</hi> foregoing, for here is no Aſſignation or Novation, for this is all this whole one, and the ſame Contract; whereas in the other there ſeems to be a new contract, deſtructive of the former; nay, its not ſo much as <hi>Contractus ceſſionis,</hi> which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Acceptant to be the Drawers Debtor alwayes, and if it were, yet here is no mention made of any ſuch Contract; wherefore theſe Bills are only a bare order to the Acceptant to pay, and the Poſſeſſor is in this as a Meſſenger and Servant to demand payment only; wherefore this being conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the common and ordinary practice of Merchants, was never doubted of.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 9. Tullius <hi>of</hi> London <hi>gave</hi> 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                     <hi>to</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Francis, <hi>who gave him Bills to receive the value at</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>payable by</hi> Francis <hi>to</hi> Mark; Tullius <hi>having received the Bills, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſeth them in a Letter of Advice, directed to</hi> Mark, <hi>and throws the Letter into the Poſt-houſe; this Letter of advice and Bills were intercepted by an unknown Perſon, who in</hi> Mark<hi>'s Name, having counterfeited his hand, goes and receives the Monyes of</hi> Francis <hi>of</hi> Amſterdam. Tullius
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:60840:181"/>
                     <hi>not knowing whether the Bills were paid or not, and afterwards adviſed, that</hi> Mark <hi>never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any ſuch Bills, he ſent him other Bills, which he procured of</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Francis <hi>for the ſame Sum; which received,</hi> Mark <hi>demands payment of</hi> Francis <hi>of</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>to whom</hi> Francis <hi>Replys, That he had already paid the firſt Bills; whereupon</hi> Tullius <hi>being adviſed thereof, demands reſtitution of</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Francis, <hi>or elſe order them to be paid. This</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Francis <hi>refuſe to do, alledging them to be paid; in this caſe, the doubt is, whether</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Francis <hi>of</hi> London <hi>must be alternative condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, either to make reſtitution, or order the Bills to be paid; and whether they remain Debtor to</hi> Francis, <hi>who paid before upon their order; or whether</hi> Francis <hi>muſt ſeek his regreſs on him, to whom he paid truly; or whether</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Francis <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>and</hi> Francis <hi>of</hi> Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>are all diſcharged, only</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Francis <hi>muſt transfer to</hi> Tullius, actionem furtevam <hi>againſt him that received the Monyes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. John</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> muſt alternatively be condemned, as above, and do not remain <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> his Debtors for what is paid by him, nor can they be moleſted by him, as having paid nothing by their order to their order; ſo that <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> muſt ſeek his redreſs on him to whom he paid. The Reaſons are theſe: 1. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> are <hi>Tullius</hi> his Debtors, till the Bills
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:60840:181"/>be paid to him, or his order. 2. Though <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> will endeavour to defend himſelf, alledging that he paid to one, whom he had juſt ground to believe was the true order of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> and that therefore upon his transferring of the action to <hi>Francis,</hi> he muſt be ſaid to have paid well; for he paid to him that preſented the Bills, and did aſſert, that he was that <hi>Mark</hi> nominated in them, and he knowing the Bills to be really the Bills of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> he therefore paid <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> and it was not for him to ſuſpect the Bills to have fallen in wrong Hands, the Remitter ſhould have better looked to them, &amp;c. Yet all this, and as much more, will not excuſe him. For this juſt ground of believing him to be the true order of the Drawer, will only excuſe the Debtor and Acceptant, if the Debt be of a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſpecies or thing, not if the Debt be in <hi>genere ſeu quantitate;</hi> for he that is indebted any certain thing, is diſcharged if the thing be loſt, <hi>non interveniente dolo vel calpâ,</hi> and ſo alſo upon the delivery thereof, <hi>bona fide facta,</hi> but in the paying of a certain Sum of Monyes its otherwiſe. Beſides, <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was ordered to pay to <hi>Mark,</hi> not to the Bearer; and by paying to him, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the limits of his Commiſſion; nor did he uſe that diligence, which he ſhould, and would have done in his own caſe, ſeeing he
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60840:182"/>would not but ſuſpect and know that ſuch caſes do often happen, or at leaſt may, and he ſhould not pay but to a certain and known Perſon; wherefore he being faulty, his Negligence can Prejudice none but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But if</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Francis <hi>demand Reſtitution of the Bills, when</hi> Tullius <hi>demands Reſtitution of the Monyes; for</hi> Francis <hi>of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam <hi>will not part with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This notwithſtanding <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> muſt make Reſtitution, for the Bills are in the Hands of their Factor and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, and he muſt ſeek them there.</p>
                  <p>Caſe 10. <hi>That an Acceptant may accept</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra Proteſt, <hi>either in honour of the Drawer, or in honour of ſome Endorſer, &amp;c. and thereby oblige him for whoſe honour he accepts, &amp;c. is before declared. But ſuppoſe</hi> Tullius <hi>is indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you</hi> 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> Sterling, <hi>and to me as much, and</hi> Tullius <hi>writes to you, That he will remit into my Hands the</hi> 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                     <hi>for you, and order you to draw the ſame upon me, which</hi> Tullius <hi>alſo doth, and orders me to accept your Bills, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you value upon me; but though I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Monyes to anſwer your Bills with, he being indebted to me, I keep the ſame for my own account, and accept your Rills</hi> ſupra Proteſt <hi>in your honour: In this caſe do I oblige you, the Drawer, for the Value paid by me?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:60840:182"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes; this I may lawfully do, though I received the Monyes poſitively with that order, to anſwer your Bills for the Value, which none will deny that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Merchantile Stile, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if I fear my Debtor may fail; yet no wiſe Merchant would thus diſoblige two ſpecial and ſure Friends. But in this, as in all other caſes of this Nature, he that would keep the Drawer obliged for that Draught (or any other Endorſer) he muſt, after the Proteſt is made and compleated, write upon the Bill, <hi>Accepted</hi> ſupra Proteſt <hi>in honour of ſuch and ſuch a one.</hi> And <hi>2dly,</hi> He muſt pay <hi>ſupra Proteſt</hi> alſo, or elſe it will be judged that he receeded from the firſt Proteſt, and accepted and paid freely and ſimply. <hi>3dly,</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:60840:183"/>not another; yea, if there were but any ground of ſuſpicion that the Figures were altered, its ſtill the ſame; but <hi>2dly,</hi> If the Falſification were ſo neat, that it could not ſo eaſily be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned nor ſuſpected, then the Acceptant pays well, and will be diſcharged both from the Remitter and the Drawer, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptant may ſeek his re-imburſment from the Drawer, and the Drawer muſt ſeek his from the Remitter, he making no Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at the Receipt of the open Letters, for the badneſs of the Characters, &amp;c. the Fault is his.</p>

                  <p>I think I need not tell the Reader, that Bills unſubſcribed are like Bonds without Seals, and are not obligatory at all, and can ſcarce think that any Acceptant would accept ſuch a Bill; wherefore that I may not ſwell the Book with unneceſſary caſes which ſeldom happen, I ſhall ſummarily hint at ſome things that remain, and ſo conclude, hoping that the Reaſons contained in this Book, and theſe Caſes reſolved in it, will direct the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and judicious in any caſe whatever that may happen to them, whether <hi>Drawers, Remitters, Acceptants</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſſors,</hi> or any other way concerned in Bills of Exchange.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLIV.</hi> Of the Execution of Exchanges.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I. PRoceſſes and Suits of Law, concerning Bills of Exchange, ſhould be ſummary, ſhort and quick; <hi>Preſent Execution,</hi> that is, attachment of Goods and arreſt of Perſon, does alwayes attend a proteſted Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. But,</p>
               <p>II. If Bills be returned empty without proteſt, they cannot be priviledged with this extraordinary procedure, but are only look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as ordinary Bills or Bonds.</p>
               <p>III. Though a third perſon be concerned in a Bill that is proteſted, and both the Drawer and Acceptant are failed, yet he is not lyable to anſwer the Creditors, nor can be moleſted upon that account; for though he was obliged to the Drawer and Acceptant, what doth this obligation concern their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, he is no way obliged to them?</p>
               <p>IV. Not only the Remitter himſelf, but his Heirs, Executors, Adminiſtrators and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:60840:188"/>Aſſigns, or any other by his order may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Law upon a Bill of Exchange that was proteſted, and attach and arreſt as if he himſelf was there.</p>
               <p>V. If the Creditor, upon the return of the Bill with proteſt, do not preſently procure ſatisfaction or ſecurity, nor demand of the Magiſtrate in ſome Weeks the priviledge of a Bill of Exchange, <hi>viz.</hi> ready Execution, he loſes the priviledge of a Bill of Exchange.</p>
               <p>VI. In the caſes of Exchange, there ſhould lie no appeal from one Court to another, from an Inferior to a Superior, unleſs the Creditor were put in poſſeſſion of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands firſt, or at leaſt, that it was ſecured to him.</p>
               <p>VII. Nor can the Judges be guilty of any Praecipitancy in this caſe; for a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is a Bond and Judgment, as good as an Hypotheca, and being already <hi>res judicata,</hi> the Execution cannot be ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>VIII. For the recognizance of Bills drawn by another in another place, its not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to fetch Witneſſes from other places that can Swear they ſaw him write them, its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that by comparing of the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings it appear that the Bills are of the Drawers writing.</p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:60840:188"/>
               <p>IX. Bills of Exchange cannot, muſt not by any Authority whatever be arreſted or detained, becauſe they are introduced and confirmed by the Law of Nations, <hi>i. e.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bills.</p>
               <p>X. In caſes of Exchange, the cuſtom of places, and their municipal Laws concerning the circumſtances thereof muſt be obſerved, (as concerning the time of payment, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting, &amp;c.) more than the common Law.</p>
               <p>XI. If any ſubſcribe a <hi>tertia</hi> Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, as ſecurity for the Drawer, he is as lyable to make ſatisfaction, if the Drawer fail, as if he were the Drawer himſelf, nor need the Remitter firſt excuſe the Drawer.</p>
               <p>XII. An execution of payment, or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conter (if a Liquidate Debt, otherwiſe not) may be oppoſed to hinder the preſent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a Bill of Exchange, as alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Preſcription, <hi>deli mals,</hi> or that the Bill is not of the Drawers writing, nor ſubſcribed by him, but a counterfeit.</p>
               <p>XIII. If there be one or more Drawers, if all have ſubſcribed all the Bills, or but one of them, they are all lyable to anſwer in caſe of Proteſt.</p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:60840:189"/>
               <p>XIV. If any one concerned in a Bill of Exchange, do not do their Duty, and what the Courtifie and Cuſtom of Merchants ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth them to, they themſelves are lyable to make good all the Loſs and Damage that may happen thereby.</p>
               <p>XV. By <hi>parata Executie,</hi> is meant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments upon their Goods, or Arreſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Perſons, or both; for here the Rule and Maxim of Law hath no place, <hi>Qui non habit in aere luat in corpore;</hi> i. e. That the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one ſhould exclude the other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVI. Not only common Reaſon, and the general Cuſtoms of Exchanges allow this <hi>paratam Executionem,</hi> in caſes of Bills of Exchange, but alſo the Municipal Laws of places of Exchange.</p>
               <p>XVII. This Law and Cuſtom is of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power againſt all that are named in a Bill of Exchange, ſo far as they are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of their duty, or any way faulty: But though a third or fourth be concerned in the Bill, if their Names be not in the Bills, this Law cannot reach them.</p>
               <p>XVIII. If any by this ready Execution, do ſuffer wrongfully, they have their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs againſt the actor, in an ordinary way only, and may recover Damages.</p>
